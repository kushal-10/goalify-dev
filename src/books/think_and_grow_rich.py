& GROW RICH   \nWHAT DO YOU WANT MOST?\nIs It Money, Fame, Power,\nContentment, Personality,\nPeace of Mind, Happiness?\nThe Thirteen Steps to Riches described in this book offer the shortest \ndependable philosophy of individual achievement ever presented for the benefit \nof the man or woman who is searching for a definite goal in life.\nBefore beginning the book you will profit greatly if you recognize the fact \nthat the book was not written to entertain. You cannot digest the contents properly \nin a week or a month. \nAfter reading the book thoroughly, Dr. Miller Reese Hutchison, nationally \nknown Consulting Engineer and long-time associate of Thomas A. Edison, said— \n\"This is not a novel. It is a textbook on individual achievement that came directly \nfrom the experiences of hundreds of America's most successful men. It should be \nstudied, digested, and meditated upon. No more than one chapter should be read \nin a single night. The reader should underline the sentences which impress him \nmost. Later, he should go back to these marked lines and read them again. A real \nstudent will not merely read this book, he will absorb its contents and make them his \nown. This book should be adopted by all high schools and no boy or girl should \nbe permitted to graduate without having satisfactorily passed an examination on \nit. This philosophy will not take the place of the subjects taught in schools, but it \nwill enable one to organize and apply the knowledge acquired, and convert it into \nuseful service and adequate compensation without waste of time.\nDr. John R. Turner, Dean of the College of The City of New York, after \nhaving read the book, said— \"The very best example of the soundness of this \nphilosophy is your own son, Blair, whose dramatic story you have outlined in \nthe chapter on Desire.\"\nDr. Turner had reference to the author's son, who, born without normal \nhearing capacity, not only avoided becoming a deaf mute, but actually converted \nhis handicap into a priceless asset by applying the philosophy here described. \nAfter reading the story (starting on page 52), you will realize that you are about \nto come into possession of a philosophy which can be transmuted into material \nwealth, or serve as readily to bring you peace of mind, understanding, spiritual \nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover  How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n  www.think-and-grow-rich-ebook.com  \n4\n  THINK & GROW RICH   \nharmony, and in some instances, as in the case of the author's son, it can. help \nyou master physical affliction. \nThe author discovered, through personally analyzing hundreds of \nsuccessful men, that all of them followed the habit of exchanging ideas, through \nwhat is commonly called conferences. When they had problems to be solved they \nsat down together and talked freely until they discovered, from their joint \ncontribution of ideas, a plan that would serve their purpose. \nYou, who read this book, will get most out of it by putting into practice \nthe Master Mind principle described in the book. This you can do (as others are \ndoing so successfully) by forming a study club, consisting of any desired number \nof people who are friendly and harmonious. The club should have a meeting at \nregular periods, as often as once each week. The procedure should consist of \nreading one chapter of the book at each meeting, after which the contents of the \nchapter should be freely discussed by all members. Each member should make \nnotes, putting down ALL IDEAS OF HIS OWN inspired by the discussion. Each \nmember should carefully read and analyze each chapter several days prior to its \nopen reading and joint discussion in the club. The reading at the club should be \ndone by someone who reads well and understands how to put color and feeling \ninto the lines. \nBy following this plan every reader will get from its pages, not only the \nsum total of the best knowledge organized from the experiences of hundreds of \nsuccessful men, but more important by far, he will tap new sources of knowledge in \nhis own mind as well as acquire knowledge of priceless value FROM EVERY OTHER \nPERSON PRESENT. \nIf you follow this plan persistently you will be almost certain to uncover \nand appropriate the secret formula by which Andrew Carnegie acquired his \nhuge fortune, as referred to in the author's introduction. \nTRIBUTES TO THE AUTHOR\nFrom Great American Leaders\n\"THINK AND GROW RICH\" was 25 years in the making.

It describes WHAT TO DO, also, \nHOW TO DO IT! \nIt presents complete instructions on HOW TO SELL YOUR PERSONAL \nSERVICES. \nIt provides you with a perfect system of self-analysis that will readily \ndisclose what has been standing between you and \"the big money\" in the past. \nIt describes the famous Andrew Carnegie formula of personal \nachievement by which he accumulated hundreds of millions of dollars for \nhimself and made no fewer than a score of millionaires of men to whom he \ntaught his secret. \nPerhaps you do not need all that is to be found in the book— no one of the \n500 men from whose experiences it was written did— but you may need ONE \nIDEA, PLAN OR SUGGESTION to start you toward your goal. Somewhere in \nthe book you will find this needed stimulus. \nThe book was inspired by Andrew Carnegie, after he had made his \nmillions and retired. It was written by the man to whom Carnegie disclosed the \nastounding secret of his riches— the same man to whom the 500 wealthy men \nrevealed the source of their riches. \nIn this volume will be found the thirteen principles of money-making \nessential to every person who accumulates sufficient money to guarantee \nfinancial independence. It is estimated that the research which went into the \npreparation, before the book was written, or could be written— research \ncovering more than twenty-five years of continuous effort— could not be \nduplicated at a cost of less than $100,000.00. \nMoreover, the knowledge contained in the book never can be duplicated, \nat any cost, for the reason that more than half of the 500 men who supplied the \ninformation it brings have passed on.\nRiches cannot always be measured in money!\nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover  How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n  www.think-and-grow-rich-ebook.com  \n8\n  THINK & GROW RICH   \nMoney and material things are essential for freedom of body and mind, \nbut there are some who will feel that the greatest of all riches can be evaluated \nonly in terms of lasting friendships, harmonious family relationships, sympathy \nand understanding between business associates, and introspective harmony \nwhich brings one peace of mind measurable only in spiritual values!\nAll who read, understand and apply this philosophy will be better \nprepared to attract and enjoy these higher estates which always have been and \nalways will be denied to all except those who are ready for them.\nBe prepared, therefore, when you expose yourself to the influence of this \nphilosophy, to experience a CHANGED LIFE which may help you not only to \nnegotiate your way through life with harmony and understanding, but also to \nprepare you for the accumulation of material riches in abundance.\nTHE PUBLISHER. \nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover  How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n  www.think-and-grow-rich-ebook.com  \n9\n  THINK & GROW RICH   \nAUTHOR'S PREFACE\nIN EVERY chapter of this book, mention has been made of the money-\nmaking secret which has made fortunes for more than five hundred exceedingly \nwealthy men whom I have carefully analyzed over a long period of years. \nThe secret was brought to my attention by Andrew Carnegie, more than a \nquarter of a century ago. The canny, lovable old Scotsman carelessly tossed it \ninto my mind, when I was but a boy. Then he sat back in his chair, with a merry \ntwinkle in his eyes, and watched carefully to see if I had brains enough to \nunderstand the full significance of what he had said to me. \nWhen he saw that I had grasped the idea, he asked if I would be willing to \nspend twenty years or more, preparing myself to take it to the world, to men and \nwomen who, without the secret, might go through life as failures. I said I would, \nand with Mr. Carnegie's cooperation, I have kept my promise. \nThis book contains the secret, after having been put to a practical test by \nthousands of people, in almost every walk of life. It was Mr. Carnegie's idea that \nthe magic formula, which gave him a stupendous fortune, ought to be placed \nwithin reach of people who do not have time to investigate how men make \nmoney, and it was his hope that I might test and demonstrate the soundness of \nthe formula through the experience of men and women in every calling. He \nbelieved the formula should be taught in all public schools and colleges, and \nexpressed the opinion that if it were properly taught it would so revolutionize \nthe entire educational system that the time spent in school could be reduced to \nless than half. \nHis experience with Charles M. Schwab, and other young men of Mr. \nSchwab's type, convinced Mr. Carnegie that much of that which is taught in the \nschools is of no value whatsoever in connection with the business of earning a \nliving or accumulating riches. He had arrived at this decision, because he had \ntaken into his business one young man after another, many of them with but \nlittle schooling, and by coaching them in the use of this formula, developed in \nthem rare leadership. Moreover, his coaching made fortunes for everyone of them who \nfollowed his instructions. \nIn the chapter on Faith, you will read the astounding story of the \norganization of the giant United States Steel Corporation, as it was conceived and \ncarried out by one of the young men through whom Mr. Carnegie proved that \nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover  How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n  www.think-and-grow-rich-ebook.com  \n10\n  THINK & GROW RICH   \nhis formula will work for all who are ready for it. This single application of the \nsecret, by that young man— Charles M. Schwab— made him a huge fortune in \nboth money and OPPORTUNITY. Roughly speaking, this particular application \nof the formula was worth six hundred million dollars.\nThese facts—and they are facts well known to almost everyone who knew \nMr. Carnegie— give you a fair idea of what the reading of this book may bring to \nyou, provided you KNOW WHAT IT IS THAT YOU WANT. \nEven before it had undergone twenty years of practical testing, the secret \nwas passed on to more than one hundred thousand men and women who have \nused it for their personal benefit, as Mr. Carnegie planned that they should. Some \nhave made fortunes with it. Others have used it successfully in creating harmony \nin their homes. A clergyman used it so effectively that it brought him an income \nof upwards of $75,000.00 a year. \nArthur Nash, a Cincinnati tailor, used his near-bankrupt business as a \n\"guinea pig\" on which to test the formula. The business came to life and made a \nfortune for its owners. It is still thriving, although Mr. Nash has gone. The \nexperiment was so unique that newspapers and magazines, gave it more than a \nmillion dollars' worth of laudatory publicity. \nThe secret was passed on to Stuart Austin Wier, of Dallas, Texas. He was \nready for it— so ready that he gave up his profession and studied law. Did he \nsucceed? That story is told too. \nI gave the secret to Jennings Randolph, the day he graduated from \nCollege, and he has used it so successfully that he is now serving his third term \nas a Member of Congress, with an excellent opportunity to keep on using it until \nit carries him to the White House. \nWhile serving as Advertising Manager of the La-Salle Extension \nUniversity, when it was little more than a name, I had the privilege of seeing J. G. \nChapline, President of the University, use the formula so effectively that he has \nsince made the LaSalle one of the great extension schools of the country. \nThe secret to which I refer has been mentioned no fewer than a hundred \ntimes, throughout this book. It has not been directly named, for it seems to work \nmore successfully when it is merely uncovered and left in sight, where THOSE \nWHO ARE READY, and SEARCHING FOR IT, may pick it up. That is why Mr. \nCarnegie tossed it to me so quietly, without giving me its specific name. \nIf you are READY to put it to use, you will recognize this secret at least \nonce in every chapter. I wish I might feel privileged to tell you how you will \nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover  How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n  www.think-and-grow-rich-ebook.com  \n11\n  THINK & GROW RICH   \nknow if you are ready, but that would deprive you of much of the benefit you \nwill receive when you make the discovery in your own way. \nWhile this book was being written, my own son, who was then finishing \nthe last year of his college work, picked up the manuscript of chapter two, read \nit, and discovered the secret for himself. He used the information so effectively \nthat he went directly into a responsible position at a beginning salary greater \nthan the average man ever earns. His story has been briefly described in chapter \ntwo. When you read it, perhaps you will dismiss any feeling you may have had, \nat the beginning of the book, that it promised too much. And, too, if you have \never been discouraged, if you have had difficulties to surmount which took the \nvery soul out of you, if you have tried and failed, if you were ever handicapped \nby illness or physical affliction, this story of my son's discovery and use of the \nCarnegie formula may prove to be the oasis in the Desert of Lost Hope, for which \nyou have been searching. \nThis secret was extensively used by President Woodrow Wilson, during \nthe World War. It was passed on to every soldier who fought in the war, \ncarefully wrapped in the training received before going to the front. President \nWilson told me it was a strong factor in raising the funds needed for the war.\nMore than twenty years ago, Hon. Manuel L. Quezon (then Resident \nCommissioner of the Philippine Islands), was inspired by the secret to gain \nfreedom for his people. He has gained freedom for the Philippines, and is the \nfirst President of the free state. \nA peculiar thing about this secret is that those who once acquire it and use \nit, find themselves literally swept on to success, with but little effort, and they \nnever again submit to failure! If you doubt this, study the names of those who \nhave used it, wherever they have been mentioned, check their records for \nyourself, and be convinced. \nThere is no such thing as SOMETHING FOR NOTHING! \nThe secret to which I refer cannot be had without a price, although the \nprice is far less than its value. It cannot be had at any price by those who are not \nintentionally searching for it. It cannot be given away, it cannot be purchased for \nmoney, for the reason that it comes in two parts. One part is already in \npossession of those who are ready for it. \nThe secret serves equally well, all who are ready for it. Education has \nnothing to do with it. Long before I was born, the secret had found its way into \nthe possession of Thomas A. Edison, and he used it so intelligently that he \nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover  How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n  www.think-and-grow-rich-ebook.com  \n12\n  THINK & GROW RICH   \nbecame the world's leading inventor, although he had but three months of \nschooling. \nThe secret was passed on to a business associate of Mr. Edison. He used it \nso effectively that, although he was then making only $12,000 a year, he \naccumulated a great fortune, and retired from active business while still a young \nman. You will find his story at the beginning of the first chapter. It should \nconvince you that riches are not beyond your reach, that you can still be what \nyou wish to be, that money, fame, recognition and happiness can be had by all \nwho are ready and determined to have these blessings. How do I know these \nthings? You should have the answer before you finish this book. You may find it \nin the very first chapter, or on the last page. \nWhile I was performing the twenty year task of research, which I had \nundertaken at Mr. Carnegie's request, I analyzed hundreds of well known men, \nmany of whom admitted that they had accumulated their vast fortunes through \nthe aid of the Carnegie secret; among these men were: — \nHENRY FORD\nWILLIAM WRIGLEY JR.\nJOHN WANAMAKER\nJAMES J.

I have \nnever known anyone who was inspired to use the secret, who did not achieve \nnoteworthy success in his chosen calling. I have never known any person to \ndistinguish himself, or to accumulate riches of any consequence, without \npossession of the secret. From these two facts I draw the conclusion that the \nsecret is more important, as a part of the knowledge essential for self-\ndetermination, than any which one receives through what is popularly known as \n\"education.\"\nWhat is EDUCATION, anyway? This has been answered in full detail. \nAs far as schooling is concerned, many of these men had very little. John \nWanamaker once told me that what little schooling he had, he acquired in very \nmuch the same manner as a modern loco-motive takes on water, by \"scooping it \nup as it runs.\" Henry Ford never reached high school, let alone college.

EDISON\nTRULY, \"thoughts are things,\" and powerful things at that, when they are \nmixed with definiteness of purpose, persistence, and a BURNING DESIRE for \ntheir translation into riches, or other material objects.\nA little more than thirty years ago, Edwin C. Barnes discovered how true \nit is that men really do THINK AND GROW RICH. His discovery did not come \nabout at one sitting. It came little by little, beginning with a BURNING DESIRE \nto become a business associate of the great Edison. \nOne of the chief characteristics of Barnes' Desire was that it was definite. \nHe wanted to work with Edison, not for him. Observe, carefully, the description \nof how he went about translating his DESIRE into reality, and you will have a \nbetter understanding of the thirteen principles which lead to riches. \nWhen this DESIRE, or impulse of thought, first flashed into his mind he \nwas in no position to act upon it. Two difficulties stood in his way. He did not \nknow Mr. Edison, and he did not have enough money to pay his railroad fare to \nOrange, New Jersey.\nThese difficulties were sufficient to have discouraged the majority of men \nfrom making any attempt to carry out the desire. But his was no ordinary desire! \nHe was so determined to find a way to carry out his desire that he finally \ndecided to travel by \"blind baggage,\" rather than be defeated. (To the uninitiated, \nthis means that he went to East Orange on a freight train). \nHe presented himself at Mr. Edison's laboratory, and announced he had \ncome to go into business with the inventor. In speaking of the first meeting \nbetween Barnes and Edison, years later, Mr. Edison said, \"He stood there before \nme, looking like an ordinary tramp, but there was something in the expression of his \nface which conveyed the impression that he was determined to get what he had come after. \nI had learned, from years of experience with men, that when a man really \nDESIRES a thing so deeply that he is willing to stake his entire future on a single \nturn of the wheel in order to get it, he is sure to win. I gave him the opportunity \nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover  How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n  www.think-and-grow-rich-ebook.com  \n16\n  THINK & GROW RICH   \nhe asked for, because I saw he had made up his mind to stand by until he succeeded. \nSubsequent events proved that no mistake was made.\" \nJust what young Barnes said to Mr. Edison on that occasion was far less \nimportant than that which he thought. Edison, himself, said so! It could not have \nbeen the young man's appearance which got him his start in the Edison office, for \nthat was definitely against him. It was what he THOUGHT that counted.\nIf the significance of this statement could be conveyed to every person \nwho reads it, there would be no need for the remainder of this book.\nBarnes did not get his partnership with Edison on his first interview. He \ndid get a chance to work in the Edison offices, at a very nominal wage, doing \nwork that was unimportant to Edison, but most important to Barnes, because it \ngave him an opportunity to display his \"merchandise\" where his intended \n\"partner\" could see it. \nMonths went by. Apparently nothing happened to bring the coveted goal \nwhich Barnes had set up in his mind as his DEFINITE MAJOR PURPOSE. But \nsomething important was happening in Barnes' mind. He was constantly \nintensifying his DESIRE to become the business associate of Edison.\nPsychologists have correctly said that \"when one is truly ready for a thing, \nit puts in its appearance.\" \nBarnes was ready for a business association with Edison, moreover, he \nwas DETERMINED TO REMAIN READY UNTIL HE GOT THAT WHICH HE \nWAS SEEKING. \nHe did not say to himself, \"Ah well, what's the use? I guess I'll change my \nmind and try for a salesman's job.\" But, he did say, \"I came here to go into \nbusiness with Edison, and I'll accomplish this end if it takes the remainder of my \nlife.\" He meant it! What a different story men would have to tell if only they \nwould adopt a DEFINITE PURPOSE, and stand by that purpose until it had time \nto become an all-consuming obsession!\nMaybe young Barnes did not know it at the time, but his bulldog \ndetermination, his persistence in standing back of a single DESIRE, was destined \nto mow down all opposition, and bring him the opportunity he was seeking. \nWhen the opportunity came, it appeared in a different form, and from a \ndifferent direction than Barnes had expected. That is one of the tricks of \nopportunity. It has a sly habit of slipping in by the back door, and often it comes \ndisguised in the form of misfortune, or temporary defeat. Perhaps this is why so \nmany fail to recognize opportunity.\nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover  How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n  www.think-and-grow-rich-ebook.com  \n17\n  THINK & GROW RICH   \nMr. Edison had just perfected a new office device, known at that time, as \nthe Edison Dictating Machine (now the Ediphone). His salesmen were not \nenthusiastic over the machine. They did not believe it could be sold without great \neffort. Barnes saw his opportunity. It had crawled in quietly, hidden in a queer \nlooking machine which interested no one but Barnes and the inventor. \nBarnes knew he could sell the Edison Dictating Machine. He suggested \nthis to Edison, and promptly got his chance. He did sell the machine. In fact, he \nsold it so successfully that Edison gave him a contract to distribute and market it \nall over the nation. Out of that business association grew the slogan, \"Made by \nEdison and installed by Barnes.\"\nThe business alliance has been in operation for more than thirty years. Out \nof it Barnes has made himself rich in money, but he has done something \ninfinitely greater, he has proved that one really may \"Think and Grow Rich.\" \nHow much actual cash that original DESIRE of Barnes' has been worth to \nhim, I have no way of knowing. Perhaps it has brought him two or three million \ndollars, but the amount, whatever it is, becomes insignificant when compared \nwith the greater asset he acquired in the form of definite knowledge that an \nintangible impulse of thought can be transmuted into its physical counterpart by the \napplication of known principles.\nBarnes literally thought himself into a partnership with the great Edison! \nHe thought himself into a fortune. He had nothing to start with, except the \ncapacity to KNOW WHAT HE WANTED, AND THE DETERMINATION TO \nSTAND BY THAT DESIRE UNTIL HE REALIZED IT.\nHe had no money to begin with. He had but little education. He had no \ninfluence. But he did have initiative, faith, and the will to win. With these \nintangible forces he made himself number one man with the greatest inventor \nwho ever lived. \nNow, let us look at a different situation, and study a man who had plenty \nof tangible evidence of riches, but lost it, because he stopped three feet short of the \ngoal he was seeking.\nTHREE FEET FROM GOLD\nOne of the most common causes of failure is the habit of quitting when \none is overtaken by temporary defeat. Every person is guilty of this mistake at one \ntime or another. \nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover  How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n  www.think-and-grow-rich-ebook.com  \n18\n  THINK & GROW RICH   \nAn uncle of R. U. Darby was caught by the \"gold fever\" in the gold-rush \ndays, and went west to DIG AND GROW RICH. He had never heard that more \ngold has been mined from the brains of men than has ever been taken from the earth. He \nstaked a claim and went to work with pick and shovel. The going was hard, but \nhis lust for gold was definite.\nAfter weeks of labor, he was rewarded by the discovery of the shining ore. \nHe needed machinery to bring the ore to the surface. Quietly, he covered up the \nmine, retraced his footsteps to his home in Williamsburg, Maryland, told his \nrelatives and a few neighbors of the \"strike.\" They got together money for the \nneeded machinery, had it shipped. The uncle and Darby went back to work the \nmine. \nThe first car of ore was mined, and shipped to a smelter. The returns \nproved they had one of the richest mines in Colorado! A few more cars of that \nore would clear the debts. Then would come the big killing in profits. \nDown went the drills! Up went the hopes of Darby and Uncle! Then \nsomething happened! The vein of gold ore disappeared! They had come to the \nend of the rainbow, and the pot of gold was no longer there! They drilled on, \ndesperately trying to pick up the vein again— all to no avail. \nFinally, they decided to QUIT. \nThey sold the machinery to a junk man for a few hundred dollars, and \ntook the train back home. Some \"junk\" men are dumb, but not this one! He called \nin a mining engineer to look at the mine and do a little calculating. The engineer \nadvised that the project had failed, because the owners were not familiar with \n\"fault lines.\" His calculations showed that the vein would be found JUST THREE \nFEET FROM WHERE THE DARBYS HAD STOPPED DRILLING! That is exactly \nwhere it was found!\nThe \"Junk\" man took millions of dollars in ore from the mine, because he \nknew enough to seek expert counsel before giving up. \nMost of the money which went into the machinery was procured through \nthe efforts of R. U. Darby, who was then a very young man. The money came \nfrom his relatives and neighbors, because of their faith in him. He paid back \nevery dollar of it, although he was years in doing so. \nLong afterward, Mr. Darby recouped his loss many times over, when he \nmade the discovery that DESIRE can be transmuted into gold. The discovery came \nafter he went into the business of selling life insurance.\nRemembering that he lost a huge fortune, because he STOPPED three feet \nfrom gold, Darby profited by the experience in his chosen work, by the simple \nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover  How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n  www.think-and-grow-rich-ebook.com  \n19\n  THINK & GROW RICH   \nmethod of saying to himself, \"I stopped three feet from gold, but I will never stop \nbecause men say 'no' when I ask them to buy insurance.\" \nDarby is one of a small group of fewer than fifty men who sell more than a \nmillion dollars in life insurance annually. He owes his \"stickability\" to the lesson \nhe learned from his \"quitability\" in the gold mining business. \nBefore success comes in any man's life, he is sure to meet with much \ntemporary defeat, and, perhaps, some failure. When defeat overtakes a man, the \neasiest and most logical thing to do is to QUIT. That is exactly what the majority \nof men do.\nMore than five hundred of the most successful men this country has ever \nknown, told the author their greatest success came just one step beyond the point \nat which defeat had overtaken them. Failure is a trickster with a keen sense of \nirony and cunning. It takes great delight in tripping one when success is almost \nwithin reach. \nA FIFTY-CENT LESSON IN PERSISTENCE\nShortly after Mr. Darby received his degree from the \"University of Hard \nKnocks,\" and had decided to profit by his experience in the gold mining \nbusiness, he had the good fortune to be present on an occasion that proved to \nhim that \"No\" does not necessarily mean no. \nOne afternoon he was helping his uncle grind wheat in an old fashioned \nmill. The uncle operated a large farm on which a number of colored sharecrop \nfarmers lived. Quietly, the door was opened, and a small colored child, the \ndaughter of a tenant, walked in and took her place near the door.\nThe uncle looked up, saw the child, and barked at her roughly, \"what do \nyou want?\"\nMeekly, the child replied, \"My mammy say send her fifty cents.\" \n\"I'll not do it,\" the uncle retorted, \"Now you run on home.\"\n\"Yas sah,\" the child replied. But she did not move. \nThe uncle went ahead with his work, so busily engaged that he did not \npay enough attention to the child to observe that she did not leave. When he \nlooked up and saw her still standing there, he yelled at her, \"I told you to go on \nhome! Now go, or I'll take a switch to you.\" \nThe little girl said \"yas sah,\" but she did not budge an inch.\nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover  How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n  www.think-and-grow-rich-ebook.com  \n20\n  THINK & GROW RICH   \nThe uncle dropped a sack of grain he was about to pour into the mill \nhopper, picked up a barrel stave, and started toward the child with an expression \non his face that indicated trouble. \nDarby held his breath. He was certain he was about to witness a murder. \nHe knew his uncle had a fierce temper. He knew that colored children were not \nsupposed to defy white people in that part of the country. \nWhen the uncle reached the spot where the child was standing, she \nquickly stepped forward one step, looked up into his eyes, and screamed at the \ntop of her shrill voice, \"MY MAMMY'S GOTTA HAVE THAT FIFTY CENTS!\" \nThe uncle stopped, looked at her for a minute, then slowly laid the barrel \nstave on the floor, put his hand in his pocket, took out half a dollar, and gave it to \nher. \nThe child took the money and slowly backed toward the door, never \ntaking her eyes off the man whom she had just conquered. After she had gone, the \nuncle sat down on a box and looked out the window into space for more than ten \nminutes. He was pondering, with awe, over the whipping he had just taken. \nMr. Darby, too, was doing some thinking. That was the first time in all his \nexperience that he had seen a colored child deliberately master an adult white \nperson. How did she do it? What happened to his uncle that caused him to lose \nhis fierceness and become as docile as a lamb? What strange power did this child \nuse that made her master over her superior? These and other similar questions \nflashed into Darby's mind, but he did not find the answer until years later, when \nhe told me the story. \nStrangely, the story of this unusual experience was told to the author in \nthe old mill, on the very spot where the uncle took his whipping. Strangely, too, I \nhad devoted nearly a quarter of a century to the study of the power which \nenabled an ignorant, illiterate colored child to conquer an intelligent man.\nAs we stood there in that musty old mill, Mr. Darby repeated the story of \nthe unusual conquest, and finished by asking, \"What can you make of it? What \nstrange power did that child use, that so completely whipped my uncle?\" \nThe answer to his question will be found in the principles described in this \nbook. The answer is full and complete. It contains details and instructions \nsufficient to enable anyone to understand, and apply the same force which the \nlittle child accidentally stumbled upon. \nKeep your mind alert, and you will observe exactly what strange power \ncame to the rescue of the child, you will catch a glimpse of this power in the next \nchapter.

The awareness of this power may come to you in the first \nchapter, or it may flash into your mind in some subsequent chapter. It may come \nin the form of a single idea. Or, it may come in the nature of a plan, or a purpose. \nAgain, it may cause you to go back into your past experiences of failure or defeat, \nand bring to the surface some lesson by which you can regain all that you lost \nthrough defeat.\nAfter I had described to Mr. Darby the power unwittingly used by the \nlittle colored child, he quickly retraced his thirty years of experience as a life \ninsurance salesman, and frankly acknowledged that his success in that field was \ndue, in no small degree, to the lesson he had learned from the child. \nMr. Darby pointed out: \"every time a prospect tried to bow me out, without \nbuying, I saw that child standing there in the old mill, her big eyes glaring in \ndefiance, and I said to myself, 'I've gotta make this sale. ' The better portion of all \nsales I have made, were made after people had said 'NO'.\" \nHe recalled, too, his mistake in having stopped only three feet from gold, \n\"but,\" he said, \"that experience was a blessing in disguise. It taught me to keep on \nkeeping on, no matter how hard the going may be, a lesson I needed to learn \nbefore I could succeed in anything.\" \nThis story of Mr. Darby and his uncle, the colored child and the gold \nmine, doubtless will be read by hundreds of men who make their living by \nselling life insurance, and to all of these, the author wishes to offer the suggestion \nthat Darby owes to these two experiences his ability to sell more than a million \ndollars of life insurance every year. \nLife is strange, and often imponderable! Both the successes and the \nfailures have their roots in simple experiences. Mr. Darby's experiences were \ncommonplace and simple enough, yet they held the answer to his destiny in life, \ntherefore they were as important (to him) as life itself. He profited by these two \ndramatic experiences, because he analyzed them, and found the lesson they taught. \nBut what of the man who has neither the time, nor the inclination to study failure \nin search of knowledge that may lead to success? Where, and how is he to learn \nthe art of converting defeat into stepping stones to opportunity? \nIn answer to these questions, this book was written.\nThe answer called for a description of thirteen principles, but remember, \nas you read, the answer you may be seeking, to the questions which have caused \nyou to ponder over the strangeness of life, may be found in your own mind, \nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover  How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n  www.think-and-grow-rich-ebook.com  \n22\n  THINK & GROW RICH   \nthrough some idea, plan, or purpose which may spring into your mind as you \nread.\nOne sound idea is all that one needs to achieve success.

This is an astounding statement, \nand all the more so, when we take into consideration the popular belief, that \nriches come only to those who work hard and long. \nWhen you begin to THINK AND GROW RICH, you will observe that \nriches begin with a state of mind, with definiteness of purpose, with little or no \nhard work. You, and every other person, ought to be interested in knowing how \nto acquire that state of mind which will attract riches. I spent twenty-five years in \nresearch, analyzing more than 25,000 people, because I, too, wanted to know \n\"how wealthy men become that way. \nWithout that research, this book could not have been written. \nHere take notice of a very significant truth, viz:\nThe business depression started in 1929, and continued on to an all time \nrecord of destruction, until sometime after President Roosevelt entered office. \nThen the depression began to fade into nothingness. Just as an electrician in a \ntheatre raises the lights so gradually that darkness is transmuted into light before \nyou realize it, so did the spell of fear in the minds of the people gradually fade \naway and become faith.\nObserve very closely, as soon as you master the principles of this \nphilosophy, and begin to follow the instructions for applying those principles, \nyour financial status will begin to improve, and everything you touch will begin \nto transmute itself into an asset for your benefit.

Some \nwho will read this, will believe that no one can THINK AND GROW RICH. They \ncannot think in terms of riches, because their thought habits have been steeped in \npoverty, want, misery, failure, and defeat. \nThese unfortunate people remind me of a prominent Chinese, who came \nto America to be educated in American ways. He attended the University of \nChicago. One day President Harper met this young Oriental on the campus, \nstopped to chat with him for a few minutes, and asked what had impressed him \nas being the most noticeable characteristic of the American people.\n\"Why,\" the Chinaman exclaimed, \"the queer slant of your eyes.

He \nchose to build an engine with the entire eight cylinders cast in one block, and \ninstructed his engineers to produce a design for the engine.

There was nothing else for them to do, if they \nwere to remain on the Ford staff. Six months went by, nothing happened. \nAnother six months passed, and still nothing happened. The engineers tried \nevery conceivable plan to carry out the orders, but the thing seemed out of the \nquestion; \"impossible!\"\nAt the end of the year Ford checked with his engineers, and again they \ninformed him they had found no way to carry out his orders. \n\"Go right ahead,\" said Ford, \"I want it, and I'll have it.\"\nThey went ahead, and then, as if by a stroke of magic, the secret was \ndiscovered. \nThe Ford DETERMINATION had won once more! \nThis story may not be described with minute accuracy, but the sum and \nsubstance of it is correct.

Barnes climbed down from the freight train in Orange, \nN. J., more than thirty years ago, he may have resembled a tramp, but his \nthoughts were those of a king! \nAs he made his way from the railroad tracks to Thomas A. Edison's office, \nhis mind was at work. He saw himself standing in Edison's presence. He heard \nhimself asking Mr. Edison for an opportunity to carry out the one CONSUMING \nOBSESSION OF HIS LIFE, a BURNING DESIRE to become the business associate \nof the great inventor.\nBarnes' desire was not a hope! It was not a wish! It was a keen, pulsating \nDESIRE, which transcended everything else. It was DEFINITE.\nThe desire was not new when he approached Edison. It had been Barnes' \ndominating desire for a long time. In the beginning, when the desire first appeared \nin his mind, it may have been, probably was, only a wish, but it was no mere \nwish when he appeared before Edison with it. \nA few years later, Edwin C. Barnes again stood before Edison, in the same \noffice where he first met the inventor. This time his DESIRE had been translated \ninto reality. He was in business with Edison. The dominating DREAM OF HIS LIFE \nhad become a reality. Today, people who know Barnes envy him, because of the \n\"break\" life yielded him. They see him in the days of his triumph, without taking \nthe trouble to investigate the cause of his success. \nBarnes succeeded because he chose a definite goal, placed all his energy, \nall his will power, all his effort, everything back of that goal. He did not become \nthe partner of Edison the day he arrived. He was content to start in the most \nmenial work, as long as it provided an opportunity to take even one step toward \nhis cherished goal. \nFive years passed before the chance he had been seeking made its \nappearance. During all those years not one ray of hope, not one promise of \nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover  How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n  www.think-and-grow-rich-ebook.com  \n29\n  THINK & GROW RICH   \nattainment of his DESIRE had been held out to him. To everyone, except himself, \nhe appeared only another cog in the Edison business wheel, but in his own mind, \nHE WAS THE PARTNER OF EDISON EVERY MINUTE OF THE TIME, from the \nvery day that he first went to work there.\nIt is a remarkable illustration of the power of a DEFINITE DESIRE. Barnes \nwon his goal, because he wanted to be a business associate of Mr. Edison, more \nthan he wanted anything else. He created a plan by which to attain that purpose.\nBut he BURNED ALL BRIDGES BEHIND HIM. \nHe stood by his DESIRE until it became the dominating obsession of his \nlife— and— finally, a fact. \nWhen he went to Orange, he did not say to himself, \"I will try to induce \nEdison to give me a job of some soft.\" He said, \"I will see Edison, and put him on \nnotice that I have come to go into business with him.\nHe did not say, \"I will work there for a few months, and if I get no \nencouragement, I will quit and get a job somewhere else.\" He did say, \"I will start \nanywhere. I will do anything Edison tells me to do, but before I am through, I will \nbe his associate.\" \nHe did not say, \"I will keep my eyes open for another opportunity, in case \nI fail to get what I want in the Edison organization.\" He said, \"There is but ONE \nthing in this world that I am determined to have, and that is a business \nassociation with Thomas A. Edison. I will burn all bridges behind me, and stake \nmy ENTIRE FUTURE on my ability to get what I want.\"\nHe left himself no possible way of retreat. He had to win or perish!\nThat is all there is to the Barnes story of success! A long while ago, a great \nwarrior faced a situation which made it necessary for him to make a decision \nwhich insured his success on the battlefield. He was about to send his armies \nagainst a powerful foe, whose men outnumbered his own. He loaded his soldiers \ninto boats, sailed to the enemy's country, unloaded soldiers and equipment, then \ngave the order to burn the ships that had carried them. Addressing his men \nbefore the first battle, he said, \"You see the boats going up in smoke. That means \nthat we cannot leave these shores alive unless we win! We now have no choice—\nwe win, or we perish! They won. \nEvery person who wins in any undertaking must be willing to burn his \nships and cut all sources of retreat. Only by so doing can one be sure of \nmaintaining that state of mind known as a BURNING DESIRE TO WIN, essential \nto success. \nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover  How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n  www.think-and-grow-rich-ebook.com  \n30\n  THINK & GROW RICH   \nThe morning after the great Chicago fire, a group of merchants stood on \nState Street, looking at the smoking remains of what had been their stores. They \nwent into a conference to decide if they would try to rebuild, or leave Chicago \nand start over in a more promising section of the country. They reached a \ndecision—all except one—to leave Chicago. \nThe merchant who decided to stay and rebuild pointed a finger at the \nremains of his store, and said, \"Gentlemen, on that very spot I will build the \nworld's greatest store, no matter how many times it may burn down.\"\nThat was more than fifty years ago. The store was built. It stands there \ntoday, a towering monument to the power of that state of mind known as a \nBURNING DESIRE. The easy thing for Marshal Field to have done, would have \nbeen exactly what his fellow merchants did. When the going was hard, and the \nfuture looked dismal, they pulled up and went where the going seemed easier.\nMark well this difference between Marshal Field and the other merchants, \nbecause it is the same difference which distinguishes Edwin C. Barnes from \nthousands of other young men who have worked in the Edison organization. It is \nthe same difference which distinguishes practically all who succeed from those \nwho fail. \nEvery human being who reaches the age of understanding of the purpose \nof money, wishes for it. Wishing will not bring riches. But desiring riches with a \nstate of mind that becomes an obsession, then planning definite ways and means \nto acquire riches, and backing those plans with persistence which does not \nrecognize failure, will bring riches.\nThe method by which DESIRE for riches can be transmuted into its \nfinancial equivalent, consists of six definite, practical steps, viz:\nFirst. Fix in your mind the exact amount of money you \ndesire. It is not sufficient merely to say \"I want plenty of money.\" Be \ndefinite as to the amount. (There is a psychological reason for \ndefiniteness which will be described in a subsequent chapter).\nSecond. Determine exactly what you intend to give in return \nfor the money you desire. (There is no such reality as \"something \nfor nothing.)\nThird. Establish a definite date when you intend to possess \nthe money you desire. \nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover  How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n  www.think-and-grow-rich-ebook.com  \n31\n  THINK & GROW RICH   \nFourth. Create a definite plan for carrying out your desire, \nand begin at once, whether you are ready or not, to put this plan \ninto action.\nFifth. Write out a clear, concise statement of the amount of \nmoney you intend to acquire, name the time limit for its \nacquisition, state what you intend to give in return for the money, \nand describe clearly the plan through which you intend to \naccumulate it. \nSixth. Read your written statement aloud, twice daily, once \njust before retiring at night, and once after arising in the morning. \nAS YOU READ— SEE AND FEEL AND BELIEVE YOURSELF \nALREADY IN POSSESSION OF THE MONEY.\nIt is important that you follow the instructions described in these six steps. \nIt is especially important that you observe, and follow the instructions in the \nsixth paragraph. You may complain that it is impossible for you to \"see yourself \nin possession of money\" before you actually have it. Here is where a BURNING \nDESIRE will come to your aid. If you truly DESIRE money so keenly that your \ndesire is an obsession, you will have no difficulty in convincing yourself that you \nwill acquire it. The object is to want money, and to become so determined to \nhave it that you CONVINCE yourself you will have it. \nOnly those who become \"money conscious\" ever accumulate great riches. \n\"Money consciousness\" means that the mind has become so thoroughly saturated \nwith the DESIRE for money, that one can see one's self already in possession of it.\nTo the uninitiated, who has not been schooled in the working principles of \nthe human mind, these instructions may appear impractical. It may be helpful, to \nall who fail to recognize the soundness of the six steps, to know that the \ninformation they convey, was received from Andrew Carnegie, who began as an \nordinary laborer in the steel mills, but managed, despite his humble beginning, \nto make these principles yield him a fortune of considerably more than one \nhundred million dollars.\nIt may be of further help to know that the six steps here recommended \nwere carefully scrutinized by the late Thomas A. Edison, who placed his stamp \nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover  How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n  www.think-and-grow-rich-ebook.com  \n32\n  THINK & GROW RICH   \nof approval upon them as being, not only the steps essential for the accumulation \nof money, but neccessary for the attainment of any definite goal. \nThe steps call for no \"hard labor.\" They call for no sacrifice. They do not \nrequire one to become ridiculous, or credulous. To apply them calls for no great \namount of education. But the successful application of these six steps does call \nfor sufficient imagination to enable one to see, and to understand, that \naccumulation of money cannot be left to chance, good fortune, and luck. One \nmust realize that all who have accumulated great fortunes, first did a certain \namount of dreaming, hoping, wishing, DESIRING, and PLANNING before they \nacquired money. \nYou may as well know, right here, that you can never have riches in great \nquantities, UNLESS you can work yourself into a white heat of DESIRE for \nmoney, and actually BELIEVE you will possess it.\nYou may as well know, also that every great leader, from the dawn of \ncivilization down to the present, was a dreamer. Christianity is the greatest \npotential power in the world today, because its founder was an intense dreamer \nwho had the vision and the imagination to see realities in their mental and \nspiritual form before they had been transmuted into physical form.\nIf you do not see great riches in your imagination, you will never see them \nin your bank balance. \nNever, in the history of America has there been so great an opportunity \nfor practical dreamers as now exists. The six year economic collapse has reduced \nall men, substantially, to the same level. A new race is about to be run. The stakes \nrepresent huge fortunes which will be accumulated within the next ten years. \nThe rules of the race have changed, because we now live in a CHANGED \nWORLD that definitely favors the masses, those who had but little or no \nopportunity to win under the conditions existing during the depression, when \nfear paralyzed growth and development.\nWe who are in this race for riches, should be encouraged to know that this \nchanged world in which we live is demanding new ideas, new ways of doing \nthings, new leaders, new inventions, new methods of teaching, new methods of \nmarketing, new books, new literature, new features for the radio, new ideas for \nmoving pictures. Back of all this demand for new and better things, there is one \nquality which one must possess to win, and that is DEFINITENESS OF \nPURPOSE, the knowledge of what one wants, and a burning DESIRE to possess \nit. \nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover  How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n  www.think-and-grow-rich-ebook.com  \n33\n  THINK & GROW RICH   \nThe business depression marked the death of one age, and the birth of \nanother. This changed world requires practical dreamers who can, and will put \ntheir dreams into action. The practical dreamers have always been, and always \nwill be the pattern-makers of civilization.\nWe who desire to accumulate riches, should remember the real leaders of \nthe world always have been men who harnessed, and put into practical use, the \nintangible, unseen forces of unborn opportunity, and have converted those \nforces, [or impulses of thought], into sky-scrapers, cities, factories, airplanes, \nautomobiles, and every form of convenience that makes life more pleasant.\nTolerance, and an open mind are practical necessities of the dreamer of \ntoday. Those who are afraid of new ideas are doomed before they start. Never \nhas there been a time more favorable to pioneers than the present. True, there is \nno wild and woolly west to be conquered, as in the days of the Covered Wagon; \nbut there is a vast business, financial, and industrial world to be remoulded and \nredirected along new and better lines.\nIn planning to acquire your share of the riches, let no one influence you to \nscorn the dreamer. To win the big stakes in this changed world, you must catch \nthe spirit of the great pioneers of the past, whose dreams have given to \ncivilization all that it has of value, the spirit which serves as the life-blood of our \nown country— your opportunity and mine, to develop and market our talents. \nLet us not forget, Columbus dreamed of an Unknown world, staked his \nlife on the existence of such a world, and discovered it! \nCopernicus, the great astronomer, dreamed of a multiplicity of worlds, \nand revealed them! No one denounced him as \"impractical\" after he had \ntriumphed. Instead, the world worshipped at his shrine, thus proving once more \nthat \"SUCCESS REQUIRES NO APOLOGIES, FAILURE PERMITS NO ALIBIS.\"\nIf the thing you wish to do is right, and you believe in it, go ahead and do it! \nPut your dream across, and never mind what \"they\" say if you meet with \ntemporary defeat, for \"they,\" perhaps, do not know that EVERY FAILURE \nBRINGS WITH IT THE SEED OF AN EQUIVALENT SUCCESS. \nHenry Ford, poor and uneducated, dreamed of a horseless carriage, went \nto work with what tools he possessed, without waiting for opportunity to favor \nhim, and now evidence of his dream belts the entire earth.

Evidence that he did not dream in vain, may be found in every wireless \nand radio in the world. Moreover, Marconi's dream brought the humblest cabin, \nand the most stately manor house side by side. It made the people of every \nnation on earth back-door neighbors. It gave the President of the United States a \nmedium by which he may talk to all the people of America at one time, and on \nshort notice. It may interest you to know that Marconi's \"friends\" had him taken \ninto custody, and examined in a psychopathic hospital, when he announced he \nhad discovered a principle through which he could send messages through the \nair, without the aid of wires, or other direct physical means of communication. \nThe dreamers of today fare better. \nThe world has become accustomed to new discoveries. Nay, it has shown \na willingness to reward the dreamer who gives the world a new idea. \n\"The greatest achievement was, at first, and for a time, but a dream.\" \n\"The oak sleeps in the acorn.

Take \ncourage, for these experiences have tempered the spiritual metal of which you \nare made—they are assets of incomparable value. \nRemember, too, that all who succeed in life get off to a bad start, and pass \nthrough many heartbreaking struggles before they \"arrive.\" The turning point in \nthe lives of those who succeed, usually comes at the moment of some crisis, \nthrough which they are introduced to their \"other selves.\" \nJohn Bunyan wrote the Pilgrim's Progress, which is among the finest of all \nEnglish literature, after he had been confined in prison and sorely punished, \nbecause of his views on the subject of religion.\nO. Henry discovered the genius which slept within his brain, after he had \nmet with great misfortune, and was confined in a prison cell, in Columbus, Ohio. \nBeing FORCED, through misfortune, to become acquainted with his \"other self,\" \nand to use his IMAGINATION, he discovered himself to be a great author \ninstead of a miserable criminal and outcast. Strange and varied are the ways of \nlife, and stranger still are the ways of Infinite Intelligence, through which men \nare sometimes forced to undergo all sorts of punishment before discovering their \nown brains, and their own capacity to create useful ideas through imagination. \nEdison, the world's greatest inventor and scientist, was a \"tramp\" \ntelegraph operator, he failed innumerable times before he was driven, finally, to \nthe discovery of the genius which slept within his brain.\nCharles Dickens began by pasting labels on blacking pots. The tragedy of \nhis first love penetrated the depths of his soul, and converted him into one of the \nworld's truly great authors.

Closed minds do not inspire faith, courage, and belief. \nRemember, no more effort is required to aim high in life, to demand \nabundance and prosperity, than is required to accept misery and poverty.

I first saw him twenty-four years ago, a few \nminutes after he was born. He came into the world without any physical sign of \nears, and the doctor admitted, when pressed for an opinion, that the child might \nbe deaf, and mute for life. \nI challenged the doctor's opinion. I had the right to do so, I was the child's \nfather. I, too, reached a decision, and rendered an opinion, but I expressed the \nopinion silently, in the secrecy of my own heart. I decided that my son would \nhear and speak. Nature could send me a child without ears, but Nature could not \ninduce me to accept the reality of the affliction. \nIn my own mind I knew that my son would hear and speak. How? I was \nsure there must be a way, and I knew I would find it. I thought of the words of \nthe immortal Emerson, \"The whole course of things goes to teach us faith. We \nneed only obey.\nThere is guidance for each of us, and by lowly listening, we shall hear the \nright word.\"\nThe right word? DESIRE! More than anything else, I DESIRED that my \nson should not be a deaf mute. From that desire I never receded, not for a second.\nMany years previously, I had written, \"Our only limitations are those we \nset up in our own minds.\" For the first time, I wondered if that statement were \ntrue. Lying on the bed in front of me was a newly born child, without the natural \nequipment of hearing. Even though he might hear and speak, he was obviously \ndisfigured for life. Surely, this was a limitation which that child had not set up in \nhis own mind.\nWhat could I do about it? Somehow I would find a way to transplant into \nthat child's mind my own BURNING DESIRE for ways and means of conveying \nsound to his brain without the aid of ears.\nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover  How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n  www.think-and-grow-rich-ebook.com  \n38\n  THINK & GROW RICH   \nAs soon as the child was old enough to cooperate, I would fill his mind so \ncompletely with a BURNING DESIRE to hear, that Nature would, by methods of \nher own, translate it into physical reality.\nAll this thinking took place in my own mind, but I spoke of it to no one. \nEvery day I renewed the pledge I had made to myself, not to accept a deaf mute \nfor a son. \nAs he grew older, and began to take notice of things around him, we \nobserved that he had a slight degree of hearing. When he reached the age when \nchildren usually begin talking, he made no attempt to speak, but we could tell by \nhis actions that he could hear certain sounds slightly. That was all I wanted to \nknow! I was convinced that if he could hear, even slightly, he might develop still \ngreater hearing capacity. Then something happened which gave me hope. It \ncame from an entirely unexpected source. \nWe bought a victrola. When the child heard the music for the first time, he \nwent into ecstasies, and promptly appropriated the machine. He soon showed a \npreference for certain records, among them, \"It's a Long Way to Tipperary.\" On \none occasion, he played that piece over and over, for almost two hours, standing \nin front of the victrola, with his teeth clamped on the edge of the case. The significance \nof this self-formed habit of his did not become clear to us until years afterward, \nfor we had never heard of the principle of \"bone conduction\" of sound at that \ntime. \nShortly after he appropriated the victrola, I discovered that he could hear \nme quite clearly when I spoke with my lips touching his mastoid bone, or at the \nbase of the brain. These discoveries placed in my possession the necessary media \nby which I began to translate into reality my Burning Desire to help my son \ndevelop hearing and speech. By that time he was making stabs at speaking \ncertain words. The outlook was far from encouraging, but DESIRE BACKED BY \nFAITH knows no such word as impossible.\nHaving determined that he could hear the sound of my voice plainly, I \nbegan, immediately, to transfer to his mind the desire to hear and speak. I soon \ndiscovered that the child enjoyed bedtime stories, so I went to work, creating \nstories designed to develop in him self-reliance, imagination, and a keen desire to \nhear and to be normal. \nThere was one story in particular, which I emphasized by giving it some \nnew and dramatic coloring each time it was told.

However, I continued my practice of wrapping that \nphilosophy in bedtime stories, hoping the time would come when he would find \nsome plan by which his handicap could be made to serve some useful purpose.\nReason told me plainly, that there was no adequate compensation for the lack of \nears and natural hearing equipment. DESIRE backed by FAITH, pushed reason \naside, and inspired me to carry on. \nAs I analyze the experience in retrospect, I can see now, that my son's faith \nin me had much to do with the astounding results. He did not question anything I \ntold him. I sold him the idea that he had a distinct advantage over his older \nbrother, and that this advantage would reflect itself in many ways. For example, \nthe teachers in school would observe that he had no ears, and, because of this, \nthey would show him special attention and treat him with extraordinary \nkindness. They always did. His mother saw to that, by visiting the teachers and \narranging with them to give the child the extra attention necessary. I sold him the \nidea, too, that when he became old enough to sell newspapers, (his older brother \nhad already become a newspaper merchant), he would have a big advantage \nover his brother, for the reason that people would pay him extra money for his \nwares, because they could see that he was a bright, industrious boy, despite the \nfact he had no ears. \nWe could notice that, gradually, the child's hearing was improving. \nMoreover, he had not the slightest tendency to be self-conscious, because of his \naffliction. When he was about seven, he showed the first evidence that our \nmethod of servicing his mind was bearing fruit. For several months he begged \nfor the privilege of selling newspapers, but his mother would not give her \nconsent. She was afraid that his deafness made it unsafe for him to go on the \nstreet alone. \nFinally, he took matters in his own hands. One afternoon, when he was \nleft at home with the servants, he climbed through the kitchen window, shinnied \nto the ground, and set out on his own. He borrowed six cents in capital from the \nneighborhood shoemaker, invested it in papers, sold out, reinvested, and kept \nrepeating until late in the evening. After balancing his accounts, and paying back \nthe six cents he had borrowed from his banker, he had a net profit of forty-two \ncents. When we got home that night, we found him in bed asleep, with the \nmoney tightly clenched in his hand. \nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover  How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n  www.think-and-grow-rich-ebook.com  \n40\n  THINK & GROW RICH   \nHis mother opened his hand, removed the coins, and cried. Of all things! \nCrying over her son's first victory seemed so inappropriate. My reaction was the \nreverse. I laughed heartily, for I knew that my endeavor to plant in the child's \nmind an attitude of faith in himself had been successful. \nHis mother saw, in his first business venture, a little deaf boy who had \ngone out in the streets and risked his life to earn money. I saw a brave, ambitious, \nself-reliant little business man whose stock in himself had been increased a \nhundred percent, because he had gone into business on his own initiative, and \nhad won. The transaction pleased me, because I knew that he had given evidence \nof a trait of resourcefulness that would go with him all through life. Later events \nproved this to be true. When his older brother wanted something, he would lie \ndown on the floor, kick his feet in the air, cry for it— and get it. When the \"little \ndeaf boy\" wanted something, he would plan a way to earn the money, then buy \nit for himself. He still follows that plan! \nTruly, my own son has taught me that handicaps can be converted into \nstepping stones on which one may climb toward some worthy goal, unless they \nare accepted as obstacles, and used as alibis. \nThe little deaf boy went through the grades, high school, and college \nwithout being able to hear his teachers, excepting when they shouted loudly, at \nclose range. He did not go to a school for the deaf. \nWE WOULD NOT PERMIT HIM TO LEARN THE SIGN LANGUAGE. \nWe were determined that he should live a normal life, and associate with normal \nchildren, and we stood by that decision, although it cost us many heated debates \nwith school officials. \nWhile he was in high school, he tried an electrical hearing aid, but it was \nof no value to him; due, we believed, to a condition that was disclosed when the \nchild was six, by Dr. J. Gordon Wilson, of Chicago, when he operated on one side \nof the boy's head, and discovered that there was no sign of natural hearing \nequipment. \nDuring his last week in college, (eighteen years after the operation), \nsomething happened which marked the most important turning-point of his life. \nThrough what seemed to be mere chance, he came into possession of another \nelectrical hearing device, which was sent to him on trial. He was slow about \ntesting it, due to his disappointment with a similar device. Finally he picked the \ninstrument up, and more or less carelessly, placed it on his head, hooked up the \nbattery, and lo! as if by a stroke of magic, his lifelong DESIRE FOR NORMAL \nHEARING BECAME A REALITY! For the first time in his life he heard \nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover  How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n  www.think-and-grow-rich-ebook.com  \n41\n  THINK & GROW RICH   \npractically as well as any person with normal hearing. \"God moves in mysterious \nways, His wonders to perform.\"\nOverjoyed because of the Changed World which had been brought to him \nthrough his hearing device, he rushed to the telephone, called his mother, and \nheard her voice perfectly. The next day he plainly heard the voices of his \nprofessors in class, for the first time in his life! Previously he could hear them \nonly when they shouted, at short range. He heard the radio. He heard the talking \npictures. For the first time in his life, he could converse freely with other people, \nwithout the necessity of their having to speak loudly. Truly, he had come into \npossession of a Changed World. We had refused to accept Nature's error, and, by \nPERSISTENT DESIRE, we had induced Nature to correct that error, through the \nonly practical means available. \nDESIRE had commenced to pay dividends, but the victory was not yet \ncomplete. The boy still had to find a definite and practical way to convert his \nhandicap into an equivalent asset. \nHardly realizing the significance of what had already been accomplished, \nbut intoxicated with the joy of his newly discovered world of sound, he wrote a \nletter to the manufacturer of the hearing-aid, enthusiastically describing his \nexperience. Something in his letter; something, perhaps which was not written \non the lines, but back of them; caused the company to invite him to New York. \nWhen be arrived, he was escorted through the factory, and while talking with the \nChief Engineer, telling him about his changed world, a hunch, an idea, or an \ninspiration— call it what you wish— flashed into his mind. It was this impulse of \nthought which converted his affliction into an asset, destined to pay dividends in \nboth money and happiness to thousands for all time to come. \nThe sum and substance of that impulse of thought was this: It occurred to \nhim that he might be of help to the millions of deafened people who go through \nlife without the benefit of hearing devices, if he could find a way to tell them the \nstory of his Changed World. Then and there, he reached a decision to devote the \nremainder of his life to rendering useful service to the hard of hearing.\nFor an entire month, he carried on an intensive research, during which he \nanalyzed the entire marketing system of the manufacturer of the hearing device, \nand created ways and means of communicating with the hard of hearing all over \nthe world for the purpose of sharing with them his newly discovered \"Changed \nWorld.\" When this was done, he put in writing a two-year plan, based upon his \nfindings. When he presented the plan to the company, he was instantly given a \nposition, for the purpose of carrying out his ambition. \nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover  How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n  www.think-and-grow-rich-ebook.com  \n42\n  THINK & GROW RICH   \nLittle did he dream, when he went to work, that he was destined to bring \nhope and practical relief to thousands of deafened people who, without his help, \nwould have been doomed forever to deaf mutism.\nShortly after he became associated with the manufacturer of his hearing \naid, he invited me to attend a class conducted by his company, for the purpose of \nteaching deaf mutes to hear, and to speak. I had never heard of such a form of \neducation, therefore I visited the class, skeptical but hopeful that my time would \nnot be entirely wasted. Here I saw a demonstration which gave me a greatly \nenlarged vision of what I had done to arouse and keep alive in my son's mind the \nDESIRE for normal hearing. I saw deaf mutes actually being taught to hear and \nto speak, through application of the self-same principle I had used, more than \ntwenty years previously, in saving my son from deaf mutism. \nThus, through some strange turn of the Wheel of Fate, my son, Blair, and I \nhave been destined to aid in correcting deaf mutism for those as yet unborn, \nbecause we are the only living human beings, as far as I know, who have \nestablished definitely the fact that deaf mutism can be corrected to the extent of \nrestoring to normal life those who suffer with this affliction. It has been done for \none; it will be done for others. \nThere is no doubt in my mind that Blair would have been a deaf mute all \nhis life, if his mother and I had not managed to shape his mind as we did. The \ndoctor who attended at his birth told us, confidentially, the child might never \nhear or speak. A few weeks ago, Dr. Irving Voorhees, a noted specialist on such \ncases, examined Blair very thoroughly. He was astounded when he learned how \nwell my son now hears, and speaks, and said his examination indicated that \n\"theoretically, the boy should not be able to hear at all.\" But the lad does hear, \ndespite the fact that X-ray pictures show there is no opening in the skull, \nwhatsoever, from where his ears should be to the brain.\nWhen I planted in his mind the DESIRE to hear and talk, and live as a \nnormal person, there went with that impulse some strange influence which \ncaused Nature to become bridge-builder, and span the gulf of silence between his \nbrain and the outer world, by some means which the keenest medical specialists \nhave not been able to interpret. It would be sacrilege for me to even conjecture as \nto how Nature performed this miracle. It would be unforgivable if I neglected to \ntell the world as much as I know of the humble part I assumed in the strange \nexperience. It is my duty, and a privilege to say I believe, and not without reason, \nthat nothing is impossible to the person who backs DESIRE with enduring \nFAITH. \nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover  How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n  www.think-and-grow-rich-ebook.com  \n43\n  THINK & GROW RICH   \nVerily, a BURNING DESIRE has devious ways of transmuting itself into \nits physical equivalent. Blair DESIRED normal hearing; now he has it! He was \nborn with a handicap which might easily have sent one with a less defined \nDESIRE to the street with a bundle of pencils and a tin cup. That handicap now \npromises to serve as the medium by which he will render useful service to many \nmillions of hard of hearing, also, to give him useful employment at adequate \nfinancial compensation the remainder of his life. \nThe little \"white lies\" I planted in his mind when he was a child, by \nleading him to BELIEVE his affliction would become a great asset, which he \ncould capitalize, has justified itself. Verily, there is nothing, right or wrong, \nwhich BELIEF, plus BURNING DESIRE, cannot make real. These qualities are \nfree to everyone.\nIn all my experience in dealing with men and women who had personal \nproblems, I never handled a single case which more definitely demonstrates the \npower of DESIRE. Authors sometimes make the mistake of writing of subjects of \nwhich they have but superficial, or very elementary knowledge. It has been my \ngood fortune to have had the privilege of testing the soundness of the POWER \nOF DESIRE, through the affliction of my own son. Perhaps it was providential \nthat the experience came as it did, for surely no one is better prepared than he, to \nserve as an example of what happens when DESIRE is put to the test. If Mother \nNature bends to the will of desire, is it logical that mere men can defeat a burning desire?\nStrange and imponderable is the power of the human mind! We do not \nunderstand the method by which it uses every circumstance, every individual, \nevery physical thing within its reach, as a means of transmuting DESIRE into its \nphysical counterpart. Perhaps science will uncover this secret.\nI planted in my son's mind the DESIRE to hear and to speak as any normal \nperson hears and speaks. That DESIRE has now become a reality. I planted in his \nmind the DESIRE to convert his greatest handicap into his greatest asset. That \nDESIRE has been realized. The modus operandi by which this astounding result \nwas achieved is not hard to describe. It consisted of three very definite facts; first, \nI MIXED FAITH with the DESIRE for normal hearing, which I passed on to my \nson. Second, I communicated my desire to him in every conceivable way \navailable, through persistent, continuous effort, over a period of years.

I quote the paragraph, because \nthe clue it contains is none other than DESIRE. \nEarly in her career, Mme. Schuman-Heink visited the director of the \nVienna Court Opera, to have him test her voice. But, he did not test it. After \ntaking one look at the awkward and poorly dressed girl, he exclaimed, none too \ngently, \"With such a face, and with no personality at all, how can you ever expect \nto succeed in opera? My good child, give up the idea. Buy a sewing machine, and \ngo to work. YOU CAN NEVER BE A SINGER.\" \nNever is a long time! The director of the Vienna Court Opera knew much \nabout the technique of singing. He knew little about the power of desire, when it \nassumes the proportion of an obsession. If he had known more of that power, he \nwould not have made the mistake of condemning genius without giving it an \nopportunity. \nSeveral years ago, one of my business associates became ill. He became \nworse as time went on, and finally was taken to the hospital for an operation. \nJust before he was wheeled into the operating room, I took a look at him, and \nwondered how anyone as thin and emaciated as he, could possibly go through a \nmajor operation successfully. The doctor warned me that there was little if any \nchance of my ever seeing him alive again. But that was the DOCTOR'S \nOPINION. It was not the opinion of the patient. Just before he was wheeled \naway, he whispered feebly, \"Do not be disturbed, Chief, I will be out of here in a \nfew days.\" The attending nurse looked at me with pity. But the patient did come \nthrough safely. After it was all over, his physician said, \"Nothing but his own \ndesire to live saved him. He never would have pulled through if he had not \nrefused to accept the possibility of death.\" \nI believe in the power of DESIRE backed by FAITH, because I have seen \nthis power lift men from lowly beginnings to places of power and wealth; I have \nseen it rob the grave of its victims; I have seen it serve as the medium by which \nmen staged a comeback after having been defeated in a hundred different ways; I \nhave seen it provide my own son with a normal, happy, successful life, despite \nNature's having sent him into the world without ears. \nHow can one harness and use the power of DESIRE?

When FAITH is blended with the \nvibration of thought, the subconscious mind instantly picks up the vibration, \ntranslates it into its spiritual equivalent, and transmits it to Infinite Intelligence, \nas in the case of prayer.\nThe emotions of FAITH, LOVE, and SEX are the most powerful of all the \nmajor positive emotions. When the three are blended, they have the effect of \n\"coloring\" the vibration of thought in such a way that it instantly reaches the \nsubconscious mind, where it is changed into its spiritual equivalent, the only \nform that induces a response from Infinite Intelligence. \nLove and faith are psychic; related to the spiritual side of man. Sex is \npurely biological, and related only to the physical. The mixing, or blending, of \nthese three emotions has the effect of opening a direct line of communication \nbetween the finite, thinking mind of man, and Infinite Intelligence. \nHow To Develop Faith\nThere comes, now, a statement which will give a better understanding of \nthe importance the principle of auto-suggestion assumes in the transmutation of \ndesire into its physical, or monetary equivalent; namely: FAITH is a state of mind \nwhich may be induced, or created, by affirmation or repeated instructions to the \nsubconscious mind, through the principle of auto-suggestion.\nAs an illustration, consider the purpose for which you are, presumably, \nreading this book. The object is, naturally, to acquire the ability to transmute the \nintangible thought impulse of DESIRE into its physical counterpart, money. By \nfollowing the instructions laid down in the chapters on auto-suggestion, and the \nsubconscious mind, as summarized in the chapter on auto-suggestion, you may \nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover  How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n  www.think-and-grow-rich-ebook.com  \n47\n  THINK & GROW RICH   \nCONVINCE the subconscious mind that you believe you will receive that for \nwhich you ask, and it will act upon that belief, which your subconscious mind \npasses back to you in the form of \"FAITH,\" followed by definite plans for \nprocuring that which you desire.\nThe method by which one develops FAITH, where it does not already \nexist, is extremely difficult to describe, almost as difficult, in fact, as it would be \nto describe the color of red to a blind man who has never seen color, and has \nnothing with which to compare what you describe to him. Faith is a state of mind \nwhich you may develop at will, after you have mastered the thirteen principles, \nbecause it is a state of mind which develops voluntarily, through application and \nuse of these principles.\nRepetition of affirmation of orders to your subconscious mind is the only known \nmethod of voluntary development of the emotion of faith.\nPerhaps the meaning may be made clearer through the following \nexplanation as to the way men sometimes become criminals. Stated in the words \nof a famous criminologist, \"When men first come into contact with crime, they \nabhor it. If they remain in contact with crime for a time, they become accustomed \nto it, and endure it. If they remain in contact with it long enough, they finally \nembrace it, and become influenced by it.\"\nThis is the equivalent of saying that any impulse of thought which is \nrepeatedly passed on to the subconscious mind is, finally, accepted and acted \nupon by the subconscious mind, which proceeds to translate that impulse into its \nphysical equivalent, by the most practical procedure available.\nIn connection with this, consider again the statement, ALL THOUGHTS \nWHICH HAVE BEEN EMOTIONALIZED, (given feeling) AND MIXED WITH \nFAITH, begin immediately to translate themselves into their physical equivalent \nor counterpart. \nThe emotions, or the \"feeling\" portion of thoughts, are the factors which \ngive thoughts vitality, life, and action. The emotions of Faith, Love, and Sex, \nwhen mixed with any thought impulse, give it greater action than any of these \nemotions can do singly.\nNot only thought impulses which have been mixed with FAITH, but those \nwhich have been mixed with any of the positive emotions, or any of the negative \nemotions, may reach, and influence the subconscious mind. \nFrom this statement, you will understand that the subconscious mind will \ntranslate into its physical equivalent, a thought impulse of a negative or \ndestructive nature, just as readily as it will act upon thought impulses of a \nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover  How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n  www.think-and-grow-rich-ebook.com  \n48\n  THINK & GROW RICH   \npositive or constructive nature. This accounts for the strange phenomenon which \nso many millions of people experience, referred to as \"misfortune,\" or \"bad luck.\"\nThere are millions of people who BELIEVE themselves \"doomed\" to \npoverty and failure, because of some strange force over which they BELIEVE \nthey have no control. They are the creators of their own \"misfortunes,\" because of \nthis negative BELIEF, which is picked up by the subconscious mind, and \ntranslated into its physical equivalent.\nThis is an appropriate place at which to suggest again that you may \nbenefit, by passing on to your subconscious mind, any DESIRE which you wish \ntranslated into its physical, or monetary equivalent, in a state of expectancy or \nBELIEF that the transmutation will actually take place. Your BELIEF, or FAITH, \nis the element which determines the action of your subconscious mind. There is \nnothing to hinder you from \"deceiving\" your subconscious mind when giving it \ninstructions through autosuggestion, as I deceived my son's subconscious mind. \nTo make this \"deceit\" more realistic, conduct yourself just as you would, if \nyou were ALREADY IN POSSESSION OF THE MATERIAL THING WHICH \nYOU ARE DEMANDING, when you call upon your subconscious mind.\nThe subconscious mind will transmute into its physical equivalent, by the \nmost direct and practical media available, any order which is given to it in a state \nof BELIEF, or FAITH that the order will be carried out. \nSurely, enough has been stated to give a starting point from which one \nmay, through experiment and practice, acquire the ability to mix FAITH with \nany order given to the subconscious mind. Perfection will come through practice. \nIt cannot come by merely reading instructions.\nIf it be true that one may become a criminal by association with crime, \n(and this is a known fact), it is equally true that one may develop faith by \nvoluntarily suggesting to the subconscious mind that one has faith. The mind \ncomes, finally, to take on the nature of the influences which dominate it. \nUnderstand this truth, and you will know why it is essential for you to \nencourage the positive emotions as dominating forces of your mind, and \ndiscourage — and eliminate negative emotions.\nA mind dominated by positive emotions, becomes a favorable abode for \nthe state of mind known as faith. A mind so dominated may, at will, give the \nsubconscious mind instructions, which it will accept and act upon immediately. \nFAITH IS A STATE OF MIND WHICH MAY BE \nINDUCED BY AUTO-SUGGESTION\nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover  How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n  www.think-and-grow-rich-ebook.com  \n49\n  THINK & GROW RICH   \nAll down the ages, the religionists have admonished struggling humanity \nto \"have faith\" in this, that, and the other dogma or creed, but they have failed to \ntell people HOW to have faith.

Edward Simmons and Charles Stewart Smith, their hearts full of \ngratitude for the lavish hospitality bestowed on them by Charles M. Schwab \nduring a recent visit to Pittsburgh, had arranged the dinner to introduce the \nthirty-eight-year-old steel man to eastern banking society. But they didn't expect \nhim to stampede the convention. They warned him, in fact, that the bosoms \nwithin New York's stuffed shirts would not be responsive to oratory, and that, if \nhe didn't want to bore the Stilhnans and Harrimans and Vanderbilts, he had \nbetter limit himself to fifteen or twenty minutes of polite vaporings and let it go \nat that. \n\"Even John Pierpont Morgan, sitting on the right hand of Schwab as \nbecame his imperial dignity, intended to grace the banquet table with his \npresence only briefly. And so far as the press and public were concerned, the \nwhole affair was of so little moment that no mention of it found its way into print \nthe next day. \n\"So the two hosts and their distinguished guests ate their way through the \nusual seven or eight courses. There was little conversation and what there was of \nit was restrained. Few of the bankers and brokers had met Schwab, whose career \nhad flowered along the banks of the Monongahela, and none knew him well. But \nbefore the evening was over, they— and with them Money Master Morgan — \nwere to be swept off their feet, and a billion dollar baby, the United States Steel \nCorporation, was to be conceived. \n\"It is perhaps unfortunate, for the sake of history, that no record of Charlie \nSchwab's speech at the dinner ever was made. He repeated some parts of it at a \nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover  How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n  www.think-and-grow-rich-ebook.com  \n58\n  THINK & GROW RICH   \nlater date during a similar meeting of Chicago bankers. And still later, when the \nGovernment brought suit to dissolve the Steel Trust, he gave his own version, \nfrom the witness stand, of the remarks that stimulated Morgan into a frenzy of \nfinancial activity.\n\"It is probable, however, that it was a 'homely' speech, somewhat \nungrammatical (for the niceties of language never bothered Schwab), full of \nepigram and threaded with wit. But aside from that it had a galvanic force and \neffect upon the five billions of estimated capital that was represented by the \ndiners. After it was over and the gathering was still under its spell, although \nSchwab had talked for ninety minutes, Morgan led the orator to a recessed \nwindow where, dangling their legs from the high, uncomfortable seat, they \ntalked for an hour more.\n\"The magic of the Schwab personality had been turned on, full force, but \nwhat was more important and lasting was the full-fledged, clear-cut program he \nlaid down for the aggrandizement of Steel. Many other men had tried to interest \nMorgan in slapping together a steel trust after the pattern of the biscuit, wire and \nhoop, sugar, rubber, whisky, oil or chewing gum combinations. John W. Gates, \nthe gambler, had urged it, but Morgan distrusted him. The Moore boys, Bill and \nJim, Chicago stock jobbers who had glued together a match trust and a cracker \ncorporation, had urged it and failed. Elbert H. Gary, the sanctimonious country \nlawyer, wanted to foster it, but he wasn't big enough to be impressive. Until \nSchwab's eloquence took J. P. Morgan to the heights from which he could \nvisualize the solid results of the most daring financial undertaking ever \nconceived, the project was regarded as a delirious dream of easy-money \ncrackpots. \n\"The financial magnetism that began, a generation ago, to attract \nthousands of small and sometimes inefficiently managed companies into large \nand competition-crushing combinations, had become operative in the steel world \nthrough the devices of that jovial business pirate, John W. Gates. Gates already \nhad formed the American Steel and Wire Company out of a chain of small \nconcerns, and together with Morgan had created the Federal Steel Company. The \nNational Tube and American Bridge companies were two more Morgan \nconcerns, and the Moore Brothers had forsaken the match and cookie business to \nform the 'American' group— Tin Plate, Steel Hoop, Sheet Steel— and the \nNational Steel Company.\n\"But by the side of Andrew Carnegie's gigantic vertical trust, a trust \nowned and operated by fifty-three partners, those other combinations were \nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover  How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n  www.think-and-grow-rich-ebook.com  \n59\n  THINK & GROW RICH   \npicayune. They might combine to their heart's content but the whole lot of them \ncouldn't make a dent in the Carnegie organization, and Morgan knew it.\n\"The eccentric old Scot knew it, too. From the magnificent heights of Skibo \nCastle he had viewed, first with amusement and then with resentment, the \nattempts of Morgan's smaller companies to cut into his business. When the \nattempts became too bold, Carnegie's temper was translated into anger and \nretaliation. He decided to duplicate every mill owned by his rivals. Hitherto, he \nhadn't been interested in wire, pipe, hoops, or sheet. Instead, he was content to \nsell such companies the raw steel and let them work it into whatever shape they \nwanted. Now, with Schwab as his chief and able lieutenant, he planned to drive \nhis enemies to the wall.\n\"So it was that in the speech of Charles M. Schwab, Morgan saw the \nanswer to his problem of combination. A trust without Carnegie—giant of them \nall—would be no trust at all, a plum pudding, as one writer said, without the \nplums. \n\"Schwab's speech on the night of December 12, 1900, undoubtedly carried \nthe inference, though not the pledge, that the vast Carnegie enterprise could be \nbrought under the Morgan tent. He talked of the world future for steel, of \nreorganization for efficiency, of specialization, of the scrapping of unsuccessful \nmills and concentration of effort on the flourishing properties, of economies in \nthe ore traffic, of economies in overhead and administrative departments, of \ncapturing foreign markets. \n\"More than that, he told the buccaneers among them wherein lay the \nerrors of their customary piracy. Their purposes, he inferred, bad been to create \nmonopolies, raise prices, and pay themselves fat dividends out of privilege. \nSchwab condemned the system in his heartiest manner. The shortsightedness of \nsuch a policy, he told his hearers, lay in the fact that it restricted the market in an \nera when everything cried for expansion. By cheapening the cost of steel, he \nargued, an ever-expanding market would be created; more uses for steel would \nbe devised, and a goodly portion of the world trade could be captured. Actually, \nthough he did not know it, Schwab was an apostle of modern mass production. \n\"So the dinner at the University Club came to an end. Morgan went home, \nto think about Schwab's rosy predictions. Schwab went back to Pittsburgh to run \nthe steel business for 'Wee Andra Carnegie,' while Gary and the rest went back to \ntheir stock tickers, to fiddle around in anticipation of the next move.\n\"It was not long coming. It took Morgan about one week to digest the feast \nof reason Schwab had placed before him. When he had assured himself that no \nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover  How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n  www.think-and-grow-rich-ebook.com  \n60\n  THINK & GROW RICH   \nfinancial indigestion was to result, he sent for Schwab—and found that young \nman rather coy. Mr. Carnegie, Schwab indicated, might not like it if he found his \ntrusted company president had been flirting with the Emperor of Wall Street, the \nStreet upon which Carnegie was resolved never to tread. Then it was suggested \nby John W. Gates the go-between, that if Schwab 'happened' to be in the Bellevue \nHotel in Philadelphia, J. P. Morgan might also 'happen' to be there. When \nSchwab arrived, however, Morgan was inconveniently ill at his New York home, \nand so, on the elder man's pressing invitation, Schwab went to New York and \npresented himself at the door of the financier's library. \n\"Now certain economic historians have professed the belief that from the \nbeginning to the end of the drama, the stage was set by Andrew Carnegie— that \nthe dinner to Schwab, the famous speech, the Sunday night conference between \nSchwab and the Money King, were events arranged by the canny Scot. The truth \nis exactly the opposite. When Schwab was called in to consummate the deal, he \ndidn't even know whether 'the little boss, ' as Andrew was called, would so \nmuch as listen to an offer to sell, particularly to a group of men whom Andrew \nregarded as being endowed with something less than holiness. But Schwab did \ntake into the conference with him, in his own handwriting, six sheets of copper-\nplate figures, representing to his mind the physical worth and the potential \nearning capacity of every steel company he regarded as an essential star in the \nnew metal firmament.\n\"Four men pondered over these figures all night. The chief, of course, was \nMorgan, steadfast in his belief in the Divine Right of Money. With him was his \naristocratic partner, Robert Bacon, a scholar and a gentleman. The third was John \nW. Gates whom Morgan scorned as a gambler and used as a tool. The fourth was \nSchwab, who knew more about the processes of making and selling steel than \nany whole group of men then living. Throughout that conference, the \nPittsburgher's figures were never questioned. If he said a company was worth so \nmuch, then it was worth that much and no more. He was insistent, too, upon \nincluding in the combination only those concerns he nominated. He had \nconceived a corporation in which there would be no duplication, not even to \nsatisfy the greed of friends who wanted to unload their companies upon the \nbroad Morgan shoulders. Thus he left out, by design, a number of the larger \nconcerns upon which the Walruses and Carpenters of Wall Street had cast \nhungry eyes.\n\"When dawn came, Morgan rose and straightened his back. Only one \nquestion remained.\nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover  How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n  www.think-and-grow-rich-ebook.com  \n61\n  THINK & GROW RICH   \n\"' Do you think you can persuade Andrew Carnegie to sell? ' he asked. \n\"' I can try, ' said Schwab.\n\"' If you can get him to sell, I will undertake the matter, ' said Morgan.\n\"So far so good. But would Carnegie sell? How much would he demand? \n(Schwab thought about $320,000,000). What would he take payment in? Common \nor preferred stocks? Bonds? Cash? Nobody could raise a third of a billion dollars \nin cash.\n\"There was a golf game in January on the frost-cracking heath of the St. \nAndrews links in Westchester, with Andrew bundled up in sweaters against the \ncold, and Charlie talking volubly, as usual, to keep his spirits up. But no word of \nbusiness was mentioned until the pair sat down in the cozy warmth of the \nCarnegie cottage hard by. Then, with the same persuasiveness that had \nhypnotized eighty millionaires at the University Club, Schwab poured out the \nglittering promises of retirement in comfort, of untold millions to satisfy the old \nman's social caprices. Carnegie capitulated, wrote a figure on a slip of paper, \nhanded it to Schwab and said, 'all right, that's what we'll sell for.'\n\"The figure was approximately $400,000,000, and was reached by taking \nthe $320,000,000 mentioned by Schwab as a basic figure, and adding to it \n$80,000,000 to represent the increased capital value over the previous two years.\n\"Later, on the deck of a trans-Atlantic liner, the Scotsman said ruefully to \nMorgan, 'I wish I had asked you for $100,000,000 more.'\n\"' If you had asked for it, you'd have gotten it, ' Morgan told him \ncheerfully. \n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * *\n\"There was an uproar, of course. A British correspondent cabled that the \nforeign steel world was 'appalled' by the gigantic combination.

' But that able stock \nmanipulator, Keene, went at his work of shoving the new stock at the public so \nvigorously that all the excess water— estimated by some at nearly $600,000,000— \nwas absorbed in a twinkling. So Carnegie had his millions, and the Morgan \nsyndicate had $62,000,000 for all its 'trouble, ' and all the 'boys, ' from Gates to \nGary, had their millions. \n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *\nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover  How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n  www.think-and-grow-rich-ebook.com  \n62\n  THINK & GROW RICH   \n\"The thirty-eight-year-old Schwab had his reward.

The plan by \nwhich the organization was provided with the steel mills that gave it financial \nstability was created in the mind of the same man. His FAITH, his DESIRE, his \nIMAGINATION, his PERSISTENCE were the real ingredients that went into \nUnited States Steel. The steel mills and mechanical equipment acquired by the \ncorporation, AFTER IT HAD BEEN BROUGHT INTO LEGAL EXISTENCE, were \nincidental, but careful analysis will disclose the fact that the appraised value of \nthe properties acquired by the corporation increased in value by an estimated \nSIX HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS, by the mere transaction which \nconsolidated them under one management. \nIn other words, Charles M.

Stated \nin another way, auto-suggestion is self-suggestion. It is the agency of \ncommunication between that part of the mind where conscious thought takes \nplace, and that which serves as the seat of action for the subconscious mind. \nThrough the dominating thoughts which one permits to remain in the \nconscious mind, (whether these thoughts be negative or positive, is immaterial), \nthe principle of auto-suggestion voluntarily reaches the subconscious mind and \ninfluences it with these thoughts. \nNO THOUGHT, whether it be negative or positive, CAN ENTER THE \nSUBCONSCIOUS MIND WITHOUT THE AID OF THE PRINCIPLE OF AUTO-\nSUGGESTION, with the exception of thoughts picked up from the ether. Stated \ndifferently, all sense impressions which are perceived through the five senses, are \nstopped by the CONSCIOUS thinking mind, and may be either passed on to the \nsubconscious mind, or rejected, at will. The conscious faculty serves, therefore, as \nan outer-guard to the approach of the subconscious.\nNature has so built man that he has ABSOLUTE CONTROL over the \nmaterial which reaches his subconscious mind, through his five senses, although \nthis is not meant to be construed as a statement that man always EXERCISES this \ncontrol. In the great majority of instances, he does NOT exercise it, which \nexplains why so many people go through life in poverty.\nRecall what has been said about the subconscious mind resembling a \nfertile garden spot, in which weeds will grow in abundance, if the seeds of more \ndesirable crops are not sown therein. AUTO-SUGGESTION is the agency of \ncontrol through which an individual may voluntarily feed his subconscious mind \non thoughts of a creative nature, or, by neglect, permit thoughts of a destructive \nnature to find their way into this rich garden of the mind. \nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover  How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n  www.think-and-grow-rich-ebook.com  \n66\n  THINK & GROW RICH   \nYou were instructed, in the last of the six steps described in the chapter on \nDesire, to read ALOUD twice daily the WRITTEN statement of your DESIRE \nFOR MONEY, and to SEE AND FEEL yourself ALREADY in possession of the \nmoney! By following these instructions, you communicate the object of your \nDESIRE directly to your SUBCONSCIOUS mind in a spirit of absolute FAITH. \nThrough repetition of this procedure, you voluntarily create thought habits \nwhich are favorable to your efforts to transmute desire into its monetary \nequivalent.\nGo back to these six steps described in chapter two, and read them again, \nvery carefully, before you proceed further. Then (when you come to it), read very \ncarefully the four instructions for the organization of your \"Master Mind\" group, \ndescribed in the chapter on Organized Planning. By comparing these two sets of \ninstructions with that which has been stated on auto-suggestion, you, of course, \nwill see that the instructions involve the application of the principle of auto-\nsuggestion. \nRemember, therefore, when reading aloud the statement of your desire \n(through which you are endeavoring to develop a \"money consciousness\"), that \nthe mere reading of the words is of NO CONSEQUENCE— UNLESS you mix \nemotion, or feeling with your words. If you repeat a million times the famous \nEmil Coué formula, \"Day by day, in every way, I am getting better and better,\" \nwithout mixing emotion and FAITH with your words, you will experience no \ndesirable results. Your subconscious mind recognizes and acts upon ONLY \nthoughts which have been well-mixed with emotion or feeling.\nThis is a fact of such importance as to warrant repetition in practically \nevery chapter, because the lack of understanding of this is the main reason the \nmajority of people who try to apply the principle of auto-suggestion get no \ndesirable results.\nPlain, unemotional words do not influence the subconscious mind. You \nwill get no appreciable results until you learn to reach your subconscious mind \nwith thoughts, or spoken words which have been well emotionalized with \nBELIEF. \nDo not become discouraged, if you cannot control and direct your \nemotions the first time you try to do so. Remember, there is no such possibility as \nSOMETHING FOR NOTHING. Ability to reach, and influence your \nsubconscious mind has its price, and you MUST PAY THAT PRICE. You cannot \ncheat, even if you desire to do so.

You cannot develop the desired ability for a lower price. You, \nand YOU ALONE, must decide whether or not the reward for which you are \nstriving (the \"money consciousness\"), is worth the price you must pay for it in \neffort. \nWisdom and \"cleverness\" alone, will not attract and retain money except \nin a few very rare instances, where the law of averages favors the attraction of \nmoney through these sources. The method of attracting money described here, \ndoes not depend upon the law of averages. Moreover, the method plays no \nfavorites. It will work for one person as effectively as it will for another. Where \nfailure is experienced, it is the individual, not the method, which has failed. If you \ntry and fail, make another effort, and still another, until you succeed.\nYour ability to use the principle of auto-suggestion will depend, very \nlargely, upon your capacity to CONCENTRATE upon a given DESIRE until that \ndesire becomes a BURNING OBSESSION. \nWhen you begin to carry out the instructions in connection with the six \nsteps described in the second chapter, it will be necessary for you to make use of \nthe principle of CONCENTRATION.\nLet us here offer suggestions for the effective use of concentration. When \nyou begin to carry out the first of the six steps, which instructs you to \"fix in your \nown mind the EXACT amount of money you desire,\" hold your thoughts on that \namount of money by CONCENTRATION, or fixation of attention, with your \neyes closed, until you can ACTUALLY SEE the physical appearance of the \nmoney. Do this at least once each day. As you go through these exercises, follow \nthe instructions given in the chapter on FAITH, and see yourself actually IN \nPOSSESSION OF THE MONEY! \nHere is a most significant fact— the subconscious mind takes any orders \ngiven it in a spirit of absolute FAITH, and acts upon those orders, although the \norders often have to be presented over and over again, through repetition, before \nthey are interpreted by the subconscious mind. Following the preceding \nstatement, consider the possibility of playing a perfectly legitimate \"trick\" on \nyour subconscious mind, by making it believe, because you believe it, that you \nmust have the amount of money you are visualizing, that this money is already \nawaiting your claim, that the subconscious mind MUST hand over to you \npractical plans for acquiring the money which is yours. \nHand over the thought suggested in the preceding paragraph to your \nIMAGINATION, and see what your imagination can, or will do, to create \nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover  How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n  www.think-and-grow-rich-ebook.com  \n68\n  THINK & GROW RICH   \npractical plans for the accumulation of money through transmutation of your \ndesire. \nDO NOT WAIT for a definite plan, through which you intend to exchange \nservices or merchandise in return for the money you are visualizing, but begin at \nonce to see yourself in possession of the money, DEMANDING and EXPECTING \nmeanwhile, that your subconscious mind will hand over the plan, or plans you \nneed. Be on the alert for these plans, and when they appear, put them into \nACTION IMMEDIATELY. When the plans appear, they will probably \"flash\" \ninto your mind through the sixth sense, in the form of an \"inspiration.\" This \ninspiration may be considered a direct \"telegram,\" or message from Infinite \nIntelligence. Treat it with respect, and act upon it as soon as you receive it. \nFailure to do this will be FATAL to your success.\nIn the fourth of the six steps, you were instructed to \"Create a definite plan \nfor carrying out your desire, and begin at once to put this plan into action.\" You \nshould follow this instruction in the manner described in the preceding \nparagraph. Do not trust to your \"reason when creating your plan for \naccumulating money through the transmutation of desire. Your reason is faulty. \nMoreover, your reasoning faculty may be lazy, and, if you depend entirely upon \nit to serve you, it may disappoint you.\nWhen visualizing the money you intend to accumulate, (with closed eyes), \nsee yourself rendering the service, or delivering the merchandise you intend to give in \nreturn for this money. This is important! \nSUMMARY OF INSTRUCTIONS\nThe fact that you are reading this book is an indication that you earnestly \nseek knowledge. It is also an indication that you are a student of this subject. If \nyou are only a student, there is a chance that you may learn much that you did \nnot know, but you will learn only by assuming an attitude of humility. If you \nchoose to follow some of the instructions but neglect, or refuse to follow others—\nyou will fail! To get satisfactory results, you must follow ALL instructions in a \nspirit of FAITH.\nThe instructions given in connection with the six steps in the second \nchapter will now be summarized, and blended with the principles covered by \nthis chapter, as follows:\nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover  How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n  www.think-and-grow-rich-ebook.com  \n69\n  THINK & GROW RICH   \nFirst. Go into some quiet spot (preferably in bed at night) \nwhere you will not be disturbed or interrupted, close your eyes, \nand repeat aloud, (so you may hear your own words) the written \nstatement of the amount of money you intend to accumulate, the \ntime limit for its accumulation, and a description of the service or \nmerchandise you intend to give in return for the money. As you \ncarry out these instructions, SEE YOURSELF ALREADY IN \nPOSSESSION OF THE MONEY. \nFor example :— Suppose that you intend to accumulate \n$50,000 by the first of January, five years hence, that you intend to \ngive personal services in return for the money, in the Capacity of a \nsalesman. Your written statement of your purpose should be \nsimilar to the following: \n\"By the first day of January, 19.., I will have in my possession \n$50,000, which will come to me in various amounts from time to \ntime during the interim.\n\"In return for this money I will give the most efficient service \nof which I am capable, rendering the fullest possible quantity, and \nthe best possible quality of service in the capacity of salesman of \n(describe the service or merchandise you intend to sell). \n\"I believe that I will have this money in my possession. My \nfaith is so strong that I can now see this money before my eyes. I \ncan touch it with my hands. It is now awaiting transfer to me at the \ntime, and in the proportion that I deliver the service I intend to \nrender in return for it. I am awaiting a plan by which to accumulate \nthis money, and I will follow that plan, when it is received.\"\nSecond. Repeat this program night and morning until you \ncan see, (in your imagination) the money you intend to accumulate.\nThird. Place a written copy of your statement where you can \nsee it night and morning, and read it just before retiring, and upon \narising until it has been memorized.\nRemember, as you carry out these instructions, that you are applying the \nprinciple of auto-suggestion, for the purpose of giving orders to your \nsubconscious mind.

Follow \nthe instructions given in the chapter on FAITH. \nThese instructions may, at first, seem abstract. Do not let this disturb you. \nFollow the instructions, no matter how abstract or impractical they may, at first, \nappear to be. The time will soon come, if you do as you have been instructed, in \nspirit as well as in act, when a whole new universe of power will unfold to you.\nScepticism, in connection with ALL new ideas, is characteristic of all \nhuman beings. But if you follow the instructions outlined, your scepticism will \nsoon be replaced by belief, and this, in turn, will soon become crystallized into \nABSOLUTE FAITH. Then you will have arrived at the point where you may \ntruly say, \"I am the master of my fate, I am the captain of my soul!\" \nMany philosophers have made the statement, that man is the master of his \nown earthly destiny, but most of them have failed to say why he is the master. The \nreason that man may be the master of his own earthly status, and especially his \nfinancial status, is thoroughly explained in this chapter. Man may become the \nmaster of himself, and of his environment, because he has the POWER TO \nINFLUENCE HIS OWN SUBCONSCIOUS MIND, and through it, gain the \ncooperation of Infinite Intelligence.\nYou are now reading the chapter which represents the keystone to the \narch of this philosophy. The instructions contained in this chapter must be \nunderstood and APPLIED WITH PERSISTENCE, if you succeed in transmuting \ndesire into money.\nThe actual performance of transmuting DESIRE into money, involves the \nuse of auto-suggestion as an agency by which one may reach, and influence, the \nsubconscious mind. The other principles are simply tools with which to apply \nauto-suggestion. Keep this thought in mind, and you will, at all times, be \nconscious of the important part the principle of auto-suggestion is to play in your \nefforts to accumulate money through the methods described in this book.\nCarry out these instructions as though you were a small child. Inject into \nyour efforts something of the FAITH of a child. The author has been most \ncareful, to see that no impractical instructions were included, because of his \nsincere desire to be helpful.\nAfter you have read the entire book, come back to this chapter, and follow \nin spirit, and in action, this instruction: \nREAD THE ENTIRE CHAPTER ALOUD ONCE EVERY NIGHT, UNTIL \nYOU BECOME THOROUGHLY CONVINCED THAT THE PRINCIPLE OF \nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover  How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n  www.think-and-grow-rich-ebook.com  \n71\n  THINK & GROW RICH   \nAUTO-SUGGESTION IS SOUND, THAT IT WILL ACCOMPLISH FOR YOU \nALL THAT HAS BEEN CLAIMED FOR IT.

One is general, the other is \nspecialized. General knowledge, no matter how great in quantity or variety it \nmay be, is of but little use in the accumulation of money. The faculties of the \ngreat universities possess, in the aggregate, practically every form of general \nknowledge known to civilization. Most of the professors have but little or no money. \nThey specialize on teaching knowledge, but they do not specialize on the \norganization, or the use of knowledge.\nKNOWLEDGE will not attract money, unless it is organized, and \nintelligently directed, through practical PLANS OF ACTION, to the DEFINITE \nEND of accumulation of money. Lack of understanding of this fact has been the \nsource of confusion to millions of people who falsely believe that \"knowledge is \npower.\" It is nothing of the sort! Knowledge is only potential power. It becomes \npower only when, and if, it is organized into definite plans of action, and \ndirected to a definite end. \nThis \"missing link\" in all systems of education known to civilization today, \nmay be found in the failure of educational institutions to teach their students \nHOW TO ORGANIZE AND USE KNOWLEDGE AFTER THEY ACQUIRE IT. \nMany people make the mistake of assuming that, because Henry Ford had \nbut little \"schooling,\" he is not a man of \"education.\" Those who make this \nmistake do not know Henry Ford, nor do they understand the real meaning of \nthe word \"educate.\" That word is derived from the Latin word \"educo,\" meaning \nto educe, to draw out, to DEVELOP FROM WITHIN. \nAn educated man is not, necessarily, one who has an abundance of \ngeneral or specialized knowledge. An educated man is one who has so \ndeveloped the faculties of his mind that he may acquire anything he wants, or its \nequivalent, without violating the rights of others. Henry Ford comes well within \nthe meaning of this definition.\nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover  How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n  www.think-and-grow-rich-ebook.com  \n73\n  THINK & GROW RICH   \nDuring the world war, a Chicago newspaper published certain editorials \nin which, among other statements, Henry Ford was called \"an ignorant pacifist.\" \nMr. Ford objected to the statements, and brought suit against the paper for \nlibeling him. When the suit was tried in the Courts, the attorneys for the paper \npleaded justification, and placed Mr. Ford, himself, on the witness stand, for the \npurpose of proving to the jury that he was ignorant. The attorneys asked Mr. \nFord a great variety of questions, all of them intended to prove, by his own \nevidence, that, while he might possess considerable specialized knowledge \npertaining to the manufacture of automobiles, he was, in the main, ignorant.\nMr. Ford was plied with such questions as the following: \"Who was \nBenedict Arnold?\" and \"How many soldiers did the British send over to America \nto put down the Rebellion of 1776?\" In answer to the last question, Mr. Ford \nreplied, \"I do not know the exact number of soldiers the British sent over, but I \nhave heard that it was a considerably larger number than ever went back.\" \nFinally, Mr. Ford became tired of this line of questioning, and in reply to a \nparticularly offensive question, he leaned over, pointed his finger at the lawyer \nwho had asked the question, and said, \"If I should really WANT to answer the \nfoolish question you have just asked, or any of the other questions you have been \nasking me, let me remind you that I have a row of electric push-buttons on my \ndesk, and by pushing the right button, I can summon to my aid men who can \nanswer ANY question I desire to ask concerning the business to which I am \ndevoting most of my efforts. Now, will you kindly tell me, WHY I should clutter \nup my mind with general knowledge, for the purpose of being able to answer \nquestions, when I have men around me who can supply any knowledge I \nrequire?\" \nThere certainly was good logic to that reply. \nThat answer floored the lawyer. Every person in the courtroom realized it \nwas the answer, not of an ignorant man, but of a man of EDUCATION. Any man \nis educated who knows where to get knowledge when he needs it, and how to \norganize that knowledge into definite plans of action. Through the assistance of \nhis \"Master Mind\" group, Henry Ford had at his command all the specialized \nknowledge he needed to enable him to become one of the wealthiest men in \nAmerica. It was not essential that he have this knowledge in his own mind. Surely no \nperson who has sufficient inclination and intelligence to read a book of this \nnature can possibly miss the significance of this illustration. \nBefore you can be sure of your ability to transmute DESIRE into its \nmonetary equivalent, you will require SPECIALIZED KNOWLEDGE of the \nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover  How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n  www.think-and-grow-rich-ebook.com  \n74\n  THINK & GROW RICH   \nservice, merchandise, or profession which you intend to offer in return for \nfortune. Perhaps you may need much more specialized knowledge than you \nhave the ability or the inclination to acquire, and if this should be true, you may \nbridge your weakness through the aid of your \"Master Mind\" group. \nAndrew Carnegie stated that he, personally, knew nothing about the \ntechnical end of the steel business; moreover, he did not particularly care to \nknow anything about it. The specialized knowledge which he required for the \nmanufacture and marketing of steel, he found available through the individual \nunits of his MASTER MIND GROUP. \nThe accumulation of great fortunes calls for POWER, and power is \nacquired through highly organized and intelligently directed specialized \nknowledge, but that knowledge does not, necessarily, have to be in the \npossession of the man who accumulates the fortune.\nThe preceding paragraph should give hope and encouragement to the \nman with ambition to accumulate a fortune, who has not possessed himself of \nthe necessary \"education\" to supply such specialized knowledge as he may \nrequire. Men sometimes go through life suffering from \"inferiority complexes,\" \nbecause they are not men of \"education.\" The man who can organize and direct a \n\"Master Mind\" group of men who possess knowledge useful in the accumulation \nof money, is just as much a man of education as any man in the group. \nREMEMBER THIS, if you suffer from a feeling of inferiority, because your \nschooling has been limited.\nThomas A. Edison had only three months of \"schooling\" during his entire \nlife. He did not lack education, neither did he die poor.\nHenry Ford had less than a sixth grade \"schooling\" but he has managed to \ndo pretty well by himself, financially. \nSPECIALIZED KNOWLEDGE is among the most plentiful, and the \ncheapest forms of service which may be had! If you doubt this, consult the \npayroll of any university. \nIT PAYS TO KNOW HOW TO PURCHASE KNOWLEDGE\nFirst of all, decide the sort of specialized knowledge you require, and the \npurpose for which it is needed. To a large extent your major purpose in life, the \ngoal toward which you are working, will help determine what knowledge you \nneed.

The more important \nof these are:\n(a) One's own experience and education \n(b) Experience and education available through cooperation of others \n(Master Mind Alliance) \n(c) Colleges and Universities \n(d) Public Libraries (Through books and periodicals in which may be \nfound all the knowledge organized by civilization) \n(e) Special Training Courses (Through night schools and home study \nschools in particular.) \nAs knowledge is acquired it must be organized and put into use, for a \ndefinite purpose, through practical plans. Knowledge has no value except that \nwhich can be gained from its application toward some worthy end. This is one \nreason why college degrees are not valued more highly. They represent nothing \nbut miscellaneous knowledge.\nIf you contemplate taking additional schooling, first determine the \npurpose for which you want the knowledge you are seeking, then learn where \nthis particular sort of knowledge can be obtained, from reliable sources.\nSuccessful men, in all callings, never stop acquiring specialized \nknowledge related to their major purpose, business, or profession. Those who are \nnot successful usually make the mistake of believing that the knowledge \nacquiring period ends when one finishes school. The truth is that schooling does \nbut little more than to put one in the way of learning how to acquire practical \nknowledge. \nWith this Changed World which began at the end of the economic \ncollapse, came also astounding changes in educational requirements. The order \nof the day is SPECIALIZATION! This truth was emphasized by Robert P. Moore, \nsecretary of appointments of Columbia University.\n\"SPECIALISTS MOST SOUGHT\n\"Particularly sought after by employing companies are candidates who \nhave specialized in some field— business-school graduates with training in \naccounting and statistics, engineers of all varieties, journalists, architects, \nchemists, and also outstanding leaders and activity men of the senior class.\nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover  How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n  www.think-and-grow-rich-ebook.com  \n76\n  THINK & GROW RICH   \n\"The man who has been active on the campus, whose personality is such \nthat he gets along with all kinds of people and who has done an adequate job \nwith his studies has a most decided edge over the strictly academic student. \nSome of these, because of their all-around qualifications, have received several \noffers of positions, a few of them as many as six. \n\"In departing from the conception that the 'straight A' student was \ninvariably the one to get the choice of the better jobs, Mr. Moore said that most \ncompanies look not only to academic records but to activity records and \npersonalities of the students. \n\"One of the largest industrial companies, the leader in its field, in writing \nto Mr. Moore concerning prospective seniors at the college, said:\n\"' We are interested primarily in finding men who can make exceptional \nprogress in management work. For this reason we emphasize qualities of \ncharacter, intelligence and personality far more than specific educational \nbackground.' \n\"APPRENTICESHIP' PROPOSED\n\"Proposing a system of 'apprenticing' students in offices, stores and \nindustrial occupations during the summer vacation, Mr. Moore asserts that after \nthe first two or three years of college, every student should be asked 'to choose a \ndefinite future course and to call a halt if he has been merely pleasantly drifting \nwithout purpose through an unspecialized academic curriculum.'\n\"Colleges and universities must face the practical consideration that all \nprofessions and occupations now demand specialists,\" he said, urging that \neducational institutions accept more direct responsibility for vocational \nguidance. One of the most reliable and practical sources of knowledge available \nto those who need specialized schooling, is the night schools operated in most \nlarge cities. The correspondence schools give specialized training anywhere the \nU. S. mails go, on all subjects that can be taught by the extension method. One \nadvantage of home study training is the flexibility of the study programme \nwhich permits one to study during spare time. Another stupendous advantage of \nhome study training (if the school is carefully chosen), is the fact that most \ncourses offered by home study schools carry with them generous privileges of \nconsultation which can be of priceless value to those needing specialized \nknowledge. No matter where you live, you can share the benefits. \nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover  How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n  www.think-and-grow-rich-ebook.com  \n77\n  THINK & GROW RICH   \nAnything acquired without effort, and without cost is generally \nunappreciated, often discredited; perhaps this is why we get so little from our \nmarvelous opportunity in public schools. The SELF-DISCIPLINE one receives \nfrom a definite programme of specialized study makes up to some extent, for the \nwasted opportunity when knowledge was available without cost. \nCorrespondence schools are highly organized business institutions. Their tuition \nfees are so low that they are forced to insist upon prompt payments. Being asked \nto pay, whether the student makes good grades or poor, has the effect of causing \none to follow through with the course when he would otherwise drop it. The \ncorrespondence schools have not stressed this point sufficiently, for the truth is \nthat their collection departments constitute the very finest sort of training on \nDECISION, PROMPTNESS, ACTION and THE HABIT OF FINISHING THAT \nWHICH ONE BEGINS.\nI learned this from experience, more than twenty-five years ago. I enrolled \nfor a home study course in Advertising. After completing eight or ten lessons I \nstopped studying, but the school did not stop sending me bills. Moreover, it \ninsisted upon payment, whether I kept up my studies or not. I decided that if I \nhad to pay for the course (which I had legally obligated myself to do), I should \ncomplete the lessons and get my money's worth. I felt, at the time, that the \ncollection system of the school was somewhat too well organized, but I learned \nlater in life that it was a valuable part of my training for which no charge had \nbeen made. Being forced to pay, I went ahead and completed the course. Later in \nlife I discovered that the efficient collection system of that school had been worth \nmuch in the form of money earned, because of the training in advertising I had \nso reluctantly taken. \nWe have in this country what is said to be the greatest public school \nsystem in the world. We have invested fabulous sums for fine buildings, we have \nprovided convenient transportation for children living in the rural districts, so \nthey may attend the best schools, but there is one astounding weakness to this \nmarvelous system— IT IS FREE! One of the strange things about human beings is \nthat they value only that which has a price. The free schools of America, and the \nfree public libraries, do not impress people because they are free. This is the \nmajor reason why so many people find it necessary to acquire additional training \nafter they quit school and go lo work. It is also one of the major reasons why \nEMPLOYERS GIVE GREATER CONSIDERATION TO EMPLOYEES WHO \nTAKE HOME STUDY COURSES.

This recognition is \nnot a charitable gesture, it is sound business judgment upon the part of the \nemployers.\nThere is one weakness in people for which there is no remedy. It is the \nuniversal weakness of LACK OF AMBITION! Persons, especially salaried people, \nwho schedule their spare time, to provide for home study, seldom remain at the \nbottom very long. Their action opens the way for the upward climb, removes \nmany obstacles from their path, and gains the friendly interest of those who have \nthe power to put them in the way of OPPORTUNITY. \nThe home study method of training is especially suited to the needs of \nemployed people who find, after leaving school, that they must acquire \nadditional specialized knowledge, but cannot spare the time to go back to school. \nThe changed economic conditions prevailing since the depression have \nmade it necessary for thousands of people to find additional, or new sources of \nincome. For the majority of these, the solution to their problem may be found \nonly by acquiring specialized knowledge. Many will be forced to change their \noccupations entirely. When a merchant finds that a certain line of merchandise is \nnot selling, he usually supplants it with another that is in demand. The person \nwhose business is that of marketing personal services must also be an efficient \nmerchant. If his services do not bring adequate returns in one occupation, he \nmust change to another, where broader opportunities are available. \nStuart Austin Wier prepared himself as a Construction Engineer and \nfollowed this line of work until the depression limited his market to where it did \nnot give him the income he required. He took inventory of himself, decided to \nchange his profession to law, went back to school and took special courses by \nwhich he prepared himself as a corporation lawyer. Despite the fact the \ndepression had not ended, he completed his training, passed the Bar \nExamination, and quickly built a lucrative law practice, in Dallas, Texas; in fact \nhe is turning away clients.\nJust to keep the record straight, and to anticipate the alibis of those who \nwill say, \"I couldn't go to school because I have a family to support,\" or \"I'm too \nold,\" I will add the information that Mr. Wier was past forty, and married when \nhe went back to school. Moreover, by carefully selecting highly specialized \ncourses, in colleges best prepared to teach the subjects chosen, Mr. Wier \ncompleted in two years the work for which the majority of law students require \nfour years.

He \nnow has a fleet of these bookkeeping offices \"on wheels\" and employs a large \nstaff of assistants, thus providing small merchants with accounting service equal \nto the best that money can buy, at very nominal cost.\nSpecialized knowledge, plus imagination, were the ingredients that went \ninto this unique and successful business. Last year the owner of that business \npaid an income tax of almost ten times as much as was paid by the merchant for \nwhom he worked when the depression forced upon him a temporary adversity \nwhich proved to be a blessing in disguise.\nThe beginning of this successful business was an IDEA!\nInasmuch as I had the privilege of supplying the unemployed salesman \nwith that idea, I now assume the further privilege of suggesting another idea \nwhich has within it the possibility of even greater income. Also the possibility of \nrendering useful service to thousands of people who badly need that service.\nThe idea was suggested by the salesman who gave up selling and went \ninto the business of keeping books on a wholesale basis. When the plan was \nsuggested as a solution of his unemployment problem, he quickly exclaimed, \"I \nlike the idea, but I would not know how to turn it into cash.\" In other words, he \ncomplained he would not know how to market his bookkeeping knowledge after \nhe acquired it.\nSo, that brought up another problem which had to be solved. With the aid \nof a young woman typist, clever at hand lettering, and who could put the story \ntogether, a very attractive book was prepared, describing the advantages of the \nnew system of book-keeping. The pages were neatly typed and pasted in an \nordinary scrapbook, which was used as a silent salesman with which the story of \nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover  How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n  www.think-and-grow-rich-ebook.com  \n80\n  THINK & GROW RICH   \nthis new business was so effectively told that its owner soon had more accounts \nthan he could handle.\nThere are thousands of people, all over the country, who need the services \nof a merchandising specialist capable of preparing an attractive brief for use in \nmarketing personal services. The aggregate annual income from such a service \nmight easily exceed that received by the largest employment agency, and the \nbenefits of the service might be made far greater to the purchaser than any to be \nobtained from an employment agency. \nThe IDEA here described was born of necessity, to bridge an emergency \nwhich had to be covered, but it did not stop by merely serving one person. The \nwoman who created the idea has a keen IMAGINATION. She saw in her newly \nborn brain-child the making of a new profession, one that is destined to render \nvaluable service to thousands of people who need practical guidance in \nmarketing personal services.\nSpurred to action by the instantaneous success of her first \"PREPARED \nPLAN TO MARKET PERSONAL SERVICES,\" this energetic woman turned next \nto the solution of a similar problem for her son who had just finished college, but \nhad been totally unable to find a market for his services. The plan she originated \nfor his use was the finest specimen of merchandising of personal services I have \never seen. \nWhen the plan book had been completed, it contained nearly fifty pages of \nbeautifully typed, properly organized information, telling the story of her son's \nnative ability, schooling, personal experiences, and a great variety of other \ninformation too extensive for description. The plan book also contained a \ncomplete description of the position her son desired, together with a marvelous \nword picture of the exact plan he would use in filling the position. \nThe preparation of the plan book required several week's labor, during \nwhich time its creator sent her son to the public library almost daily, to procure \ndata needed in selling his services to best advantage. She sent him, also to all the \ncompetitors of his prospective employer, and gathered from them vital \ninformation concerning their business methods which was of great value in the \nformation of the plan he intended to use in filling the position he sought. When \nthe plan had been finished, it contained more than half a dozen very fine \nsuggestions for the use and benefit of the prospective employer. (The suggestions \nwere put into use by the company). \nOne may be inclined to ask, \"Why go to all this trouble to secure a job?\" \nThe answer is straight to the point, also it is dramatic, because it deals with a \nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover  How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n  www.think-and-grow-rich-ebook.com  \n81\n  THINK & GROW RICH   \nsubject which assumes the proportion of a tragedy with millions of men and \nwomen whose sole source of income is personal services.\nThe answer is, \"DOING A THING WELL NEVER IS TROUBLE! THE \nPLAN PREPARED BY THIS WOMAN FOR THE BENEFIT OF HER SON, \nHELPED HIM GET THE JOB FOR WHICH HE APPLIED, AT THE FIRST \nINTERVIEW, AT A SALARY FIXED BY HIMSELF.\" \nMoreover— and this, too, is important— THE POSITION DID NOT \nREQUIRE THE YOUNG MAN TO START AT THE BOTTOM. HE BEGAN AS A \nJUNIOR EXECUTIVE, AT AN EXECUTIVE'S SALARY. \n\"Why go to all this trouble?\" do you ask? \nWell, for one thing, the PLANNED PRESENTATION of this young man's \napplication for a position clipped off no less than ten years of time he would \nhave required to get to where he began, had he \"started at the bottom and \nworked his way up.\" \nThis idea of starting at the bottom and working one's way up may appear \nto be sound, but the major objection to it is this— too many of those who begin at \nthe bottom never manage to lift their heads high enough to be seen by \nOPPORTUNITY, so they remain at the bottom. It should be remembered, also, \nthat the outlook from the bottom is not so very bright or encouraging. It has a \ntendency to kill off ambition. We call it \"getting into a rut,\" which means that we \naccept our fate because we form the HABIT of daily routine, a habit that finally \nbecomes so strong we cease to try to throw it off. And that is another reason why \nit pays to start one or two steps above the bottom. By so doing one forms the \nHABIT of looking around, of observing how others get ahead, of seeing \nOPPORTUNITY, and of embracing it without hesitation.\nDan Halpin is a splendid example of what I mean. During his college \ndays, he was manager of the famous 1930 National Championship Notre Dame \nfootball team, when it was under the direction of the late Knute Rockne.\nPerhaps he was inspired by the great football coach to aim high, and NOT \nMISTAKE TEMPORARY DEFEAT FOR FAILURE, just as Andrew Carnegie, the \ngreat industrial leader, inspired his young business lieutenants to set high goals \nfor themselves. At any rate, young Halpin finished college at a mighty \nunfavorable time, when the depression had made jobs scarce, so, after a fling at \ninvestment banking and motion pictures, he took the first opening with a \npotential future he could find— selling electrical hearing aids on a commission \nbasis. ANYONE COULD START IN THAT SORT OF JOB, AND HALPIN KNEW \nIT, but it was enough to open the door of opportunity to him.\nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover  How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n  www.think-and-grow-rich-ebook.com  \n82\n  THINK & GROW RICH   \nFor almost two years, he continued in a job not to his liking, and he would \nnever have risen above that job if he had not done something about his \ndissatisfaction. He aimed, first, at the job of Assistant Sales Manager of his \ncompany, and got the job. That one step upward placed him high enough above \nthe crowd to enable him to see still greater opportunity, also, it placed him where \nOPPORTUNITY COULD SEE HIM.\nHe made such a fine record selling hearing aids, that A. M. Andrews, \nChairman of the Board of the Dictograph Products Company, a business \ncompetitor of the company for which Halpin worked, wanted to know \nsomething about that man Dan Halpin who was taking big sales away from the \nlong established Dictograph Company. He sent for Halpin. When the interview \nwas over, Halpin was the new Sales Manager, in charge of the Acousticon \nDivision. Then, to test young Halpin's metal, Mr. Andrews went away to Florida \nfor three months, leaving him to sink or swim in his new job. He did not sink! \nKnute Rockne's spirit of \"All the world loves a winner, and has no time for a \nloser inspired him to put so much into his job that he was recently elected Vice-\nPresident of the company, and General Manager of the Acousticon and Silent \nRadio Division, a job which most men would be proud to earn through ten years \nof loyal effort. Halpin turned the trick in little more than six months. \nIt is difficult to say whether Mr. Andrews or Mr. Halpin is more deserving \nof eulogy, for the reason that both showed evidence of having an abundance of \nthat very rare quality known as IMAGINATION. Mr. Andrews deserves credit \nfor seeing, in young Halpin, a \"go-getter\" of the highest order. Halpin deserves \ncredit for REFUSING TO COMPROMISE WITH LIFE BY ACCEPTING AND \nKEEPING A JOB HE DID NOT WANT, and that is one of the major points I am \ntrying to emphasize through this entire philosophy— that we rise to high \npositions or remain at the bottom BECAUSE OF CONDITIONS WE CAN \nCONTROL IF WE DESIRE TO CONTROL THEM.\nI am also trying to emphasize another point, namely, that both success and \nfailure are largely the results of HABIT! I have not the slightest doubt that Dan \nHalpin's close association with the greatest football coach America ever knew, \nplanted in his mind the same brand of DESIRE to excel which made the Notre \nDame football team world famous. Truly, there is something to the idea that \nhero-worship is helpful, provided one worships a WINNER. Halpin tells me that \nRockne was one of the world's greatest leaders of men in all history.\nMy belief in the theory that business associations are vital factors, both in \nfailure and in success, was recently demonstrated, when my son Blair was \nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover  How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n  www.think-and-grow-rich-ebook.com  \n83\n  THINK & GROW RICH   \nnegotiating with Dan Halpin for a position. Mr. Halpin offered him a beginning \nsalary of about one half what he could have gotten from a rival company. I \nbrought parental pressure to bear, and induced him to accept the place with Mr. \nHalpin, because I BELIEVE THAT CLOSE ASSOCIATION WITH ONE WHO \nREFUSES TO COMPROMISE WITH CIRCUMSTANCES HE DOES NOT LIKE, \nIS AN ASSET THAT CAN NEVER BE MEASURED IN TERMS OF MONEY.\nThe bottom is a monotonous, dreary, unprofitable place for any person. \nThat is why I have taken the time to describe how lowly beginnings may be \ncircumvented by proper planning. Also, that is why so much space has been \ndevoted to a description of this new profession, created by a woman who was \ninspired to do a fine job of PLANNING because she wanted her son to have a \nfavorable \"break.\" \nWith the changed conditions ushered in by the world economic collapse, \ncame also the need for newer and better ways of marketing PERSONAL \nSERVICES. It is hard to determine why someone had not previously discovered \nthis stupendous need, in view of the fact that more money changes hands in \nreturn for personal services than for any other purpose. The sum paid out \nmonthly, to people who work for wages and salaries, is so huge that it runs into \nhundreds of millions, and the annual distribution amounts to billions. \nPerhaps some will find, in the IDEA here briefly described, the nucleus of \nthe riches they DESIRE! Ideas with much less merit have been the seedlings from \nwhich great fortunes have grown. Woolworth's Five and Ten Cent Store idea, for \nexample, had far less merit, but it piled up a fortune for its creator.\nThose seeing OPPORTUNITY lurking in this suggestion will find valuable \naid in the chapter on Organized Planning. Incidentally, an efficient merchandiser \nof personal services would find a growing demand for his services wherever \nthere are men and women who seek better markets for their services. By \napplying the Master Mind principle, a few people with suitable talent, could \nform an alliance, and have a paying business very quickly. One would need to be \na fair writer, with a flair for advertising and selling, one handy at typing and \nhand lettering, and one should be a first class business getter who would let the \nworld know about the service. If one person possessed all these abilities, he \nmight carry on the business alone, until it outgrew him. \nThe woman who prepared the \"Personal Service Sales Plan\" for her son \nnow receives requests from all parts of the country for her cooperation in \npreparing similar plans for others who desire to market their personal services \nfor more money.

She is so confident of her ability that she accepts, as the major portion of \nher fee, a percentage of the increased pay she helps her clients to earn.\nIt must not be supposed that her plan merely consists of clever \nsalesmanship by which she helps men and women to demand and receive more \nmoney for he same services they formerly sold for less pay. She looks after the \ninterests of the purchaser as well as the seller of personal services, and so \nprepares her plans that the employer receives full value for the additional money \nhe pays. The method by which she accomplishes this astonishing result is a \nprofessional secret which she discloses to no one excepting her own clients.\nIf you have the IMAGINATION, and seek a more profitable outlet for \nyour personal services, this suggestion may be the stimulus for which you have \nbeen searching. The IDEA is capable of yielding an income far greater than that \nof the \"average\" doctor, lawyer, or engineer whose education required several \nyears in college. The idea is saleable to those seeking new positions, in practically \nall positions calling for managerial or executive ability, and those desiring re-\narrangement of incomes in their present positions. \nThere is no fixed price for sound IDEAS!\nBack of all IDEAS is specialized knowledge. Unfortunately, for those who \ndo not find riches in abundance, specialized knowledge is more abundant and \nmore easily acquired than IDEAS. Because of this very truth, there is a universal \ndemand and an ever-increasing opportunity for the person capable of helping \nmen and women to sell their personal services advantageously. Capability means \nIMAGINATION, the one quality needed to combine specialized knowledge with \nIDEAS, in the form of ORGANIZED PLANS designed to yield riches.\nIf you have IMAGINATION this chapter may present you with an idea \nsufficient to serve as the beginning of the riches you desire.

The impulse, the DESIRE, is given shape, form, and ACTION \nthrough the aid of the imaginative faculty of the mind.\nIt has been said that man can create anything which he can imagine.\nOf all the ages of civilization, this is the most favorable for the \ndevelopment of the imagination, because it is an age of rapid change. On every \nhand one may contact stimuli which develop the imagination.\nThrough the aid of his imaginative faculty, man has discovered, and \nharnessed, more of Nature's forces during the past fifty years than during the \nentire history of the human race, previous to that time. He has conquered the air \nso completely, that the birds are a poor match for him in flying. He has harnessed \nthe ether, and made it serve as a means of instantaneous communication with \nany part of the world. He has analyzed, and weighed the sun at a distance of \nmillions of miles, and has determined, through the aid of IMAGINATION, the \nelements of which it consists. He has discovered that his own brain is both a \nbroadcasting, and a receiving station for the vibration of thought, and he is \nbeginning now to learn how to make practical use of this discovery. He has \nincreased the speed of locomotion, until he may now travel at a speed of more \nthan three hundred miles an hour. The time will soon come when a man may \nbreakfast in New York, and lunch in San Francisco.\nMAN'S ONLY LIMITATION, within reason, LIES IN HIS \nDEVELOPMENT AND USE OF HIS IMAGINATION. He has not yet reached the \napex of development in the use of his imaginative faculty. He has merely \ndiscovered that he has an imagination, and has commenced to use it in a very \nelementary way. \nTWO FORMS OF IMAGINATION\nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover  How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n  www.think-and-grow-rich-ebook.com  \n86\n  THINK & GROW RICH   \nThe imaginative faculty functions in two forms. One is known as \n\"synthetic imagination,\" and the other as \"creative imagination.\"\nSYNTHETIC IMAGINATION:— Through this faculty, one may arrange \nold concepts, ideas, or plans into new combinations. This faculty creates nothing. \nIt merely works with the material of experience, education, and observation with \nwhich it is fed. It is the faculty used most by the inventor, with the exception of \nthe who draws upon the creative imagination, when he cannot solve his problem \nthrough synthetic imagination. \nCREATIVE IMAGINATION:— Through the faculty of creative imagination, \nthe finite mind of man has direct communication with Infinite Intelligence. It is \nthe faculty through which \"hunches\" and \"inspirations\" are received. It is by this \nfaculty that all basic, or new ideas are handed over to man. \nIt is through this faculty that thought vibrations from the minds of others \nare received. It is through this faculty that one individual may \"tune in,\" or \ncommunicate with the subconscious minds of other men.\nThe creative imagination works automatically, in the manner described in \nsubsequent pages. This faculty functions ONLY when the conscious mind is \nvibrating at an exceedingly rapid rate, as for example, when the conscious mind \nis stimulated through the emotion of a strong desire.\nThe creative faculty becomes more alert, more receptive to vibrations from \nthe sources mentioned, in proportion to its development through USE. This \nstatement is significant! Ponder over it before passing on. \nKeep in mind as you follow these principles, that the entire story of how \none may convert DESIRE into money cannot be told in one statement. The story \nwill be complete, only when one has MASTERED, ASSIMILATED, and BEGUN \nTO MAKE USE of all the principles. \nThe great leaders of business, industry, finance, and the great artists, \nmusicians, poets, and writers became great, because they developed the faculty \nof creative imagination. \nBoth the synthetic and creative faculties of imagination become more alert \nwith use, just as any muscle or organ of the body develops through use. \nDesire is only a thought, an impulse. It is nebulous and ephemeral. It is \nabstract, and of no value, until it has been transformed into its physical \ncounterpart. While the synthetic imagination is the one which will be used most \nfrequently, in the process of transforming the impulse of DESIRE into money, \nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover  How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n  www.think-and-grow-rich-ebook.com  \n87\n  THINK & GROW RICH   \nyou must keep in mind the fact, that you may face circumstances and situations \nwhich demand use of the creative imagination as well. \nYour imaginative faculty may have become weak through inaction. It can \nbe revived and made alert through USE. This faculty does not die, though it may \nbecome quiescent through lack of use. \nCenter your attention, for the time being, on the development of the \nsynthetic imagination, because this is the faculty which you will use more often \nin the process of converting desire into money.\nTransformation of the intangible impulse, of DESIRE, into the tangible \nreality, of MONEY, calls for the use of a plan, or plans. These plans must be \nformed with the aid of the imagination, and mainly, with the synthetic faculty.\nRead the entire book through, then come back to this chapter, and begin at \nonce to put your imagination to work on the building of a plan, or plans, for the \ntransformation of your DESIRE into money. Detailed instructions for the \nbuilding of plans have been given in almost every chapter. Carry out the \ninstructions best suited to your needs, reduce your plan to writing, if you have \nnot already done so. The moment you complete this, you will have DEFINITELY \ngiven concrete form to the intangible DESIRE. Read the preceding sentence once \nmore. Read it aloud, very slowly, and as you do so, remember that the moment \nyou reduce the statement of your desire, and a plan for its realization, to writing, \nyou have actually TAKEN THE FIRST of a series of steps, which will enable you \nto convert the thought into its physical counterpart.\nThe earth on which you live, you, yourself, and every other material thing \nare the result of evolutionary change, through which microscopic bits of matter \nhave been organized and arranged in an orderly fashion.\nMoreover— and this statement is of stupendous importance— this earth, \nevery one of the billions of individual cells of your body, and every atom of \nmatter, began as an intangible form of energy.\nDESIRE is thought impulse! Thought impulses are forms of energy. When \nyou begin with the thought impulse, DESIRE, to accumulate money, you are \ndrafting into your service the same \"stuff\" that Nature used in creating this earth, \nand every material form in the universe, including the body and brain in which \nthe thought impulses function.\nAs far as science has been able to determine, the entire universe consists of \nbut two elements—matter and energy. \nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover  How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n  www.think-and-grow-rich-ebook.com  \n88\n  THINK & GROW RICH   \nThrough the combination of energy and matter, has been created \neverything perceptible to man, from the largest star which floats in the heavens, \ndown to, and including man, himself. \nYou are now engaged in the task of trying to profit by Nature's method. \nYou are (sincerely and earnestly, we hope), trying to adapt yourself to Nature's \nlaws, by endeavoring to convert DESIRE into its physical or monetary \nequivalent. \nYOU CAN DO IT!

Through \nrepetition, and by approaching the description of these principles from every \nconceivable angle, the author hopes to reveal to you the secret through which \nevery great fortune has been accumulated. Strange and paradoxical as it may \nseem, the \"secret\" is NOT A SECRET. Nature, herself, advertises it in the earth on \nwhich we live, the stars, the planets suspended within our view, in the elements \nabove and around us, in every blade of grass, and every form of life within our \nvision.\nNature advertises this \"secret\" in the terms of biology, in the conversion of \na tiny cell, so small that it may be lost on the point of a pin, into the HUMAN \nBEING now reading this line. The conversion of desire into its physical \nequivalent is, certainly, no more miraculous! \nDo not become discouraged if you do not fully comprehend all that has \nbeen stated. Unless you have long been a student of the mind, it is not to be \nexpected that you will assimilate all that is in this chapter upon a first reading. \nBut you will, in time, make good progress.\nThe principles which follow will open the way for understanding of \nimagination. Assimilate that which you understand, as you read this philosophy \nfor the first time, then, when you reread and study it, you will discover that \nsomething has happened to clarify it, and give you a broader understanding of \nthe whole.

It was \ndestined to bring to the South the most far-flung benefit since the Civil War. \nFor more than an hour, behind the prescription counter, the old doctor \nand the clerk talked in low tones. Then the doctor left. He went out to the buggy \nand brought back a large, old fashioned kettle, a big wooden paddle (used for \nstirring the contents of the kettle), and deposited them in the back of the store.\nThe clerk inspected the kettle, reached into his inside pocket, took out a \nroll of bills, and handed it over to the doctor. The roll contained exactly $500.00—\nthe clerk's entire savings! The doctor handed over a small slip of paper on which \nwas written a secret formula. The words on that small slip of paper were worth a \nKing's ransom! But not to the doctor! Those magic words were needed to start \nthe kettle to boiling, but neither the doctor nor the young clerk knew what \nfabulous fortunes were destined to flow from that kettle. \nThe old doctor was glad to sell the outfit for five hundred dollars. The \nmoney would pay off his debts, and give him freedom of mind. The clerk was \ntaking a big chance by staking his entire life's savings on a mere scrap of paper \nand an old kettle! He never dreamed his investment would start a kettle to \noverflowing with gold that would surpass the miraculous performance of \nAladdin's lamp.\nWhat the clerk really purchased was an IDEA! The old kettle and the \nwooden paddle, and the secret message on a slip of paper were incidental. The \nstrange performance of that kettle began to take place after the new owner mixed \nwith the secret instructions an ingredient of which the doctor knew nothing.\nRead this story carefully, give your imagination a test! See if you can \ndiscover what it was that the young man added to the secret message, which \ncaused the kettle to overflow with gold.

Gunsaulus, who began his preaching career in the stockyards region of South \nChicago.\nWhile Dr. Gunsaulus was going through college, he observed many \ndefects in our educational system, defects which he believed he could correct, if \nhe were the head of a college. His deepest desire was to become the directing head \nof an educational institution in which young men and women would be taught \nto \"learn by doing.\"\nHe made up his mind to organize a new college in which he could carry \nout his ideas, without being handicapped by orthodox methods of education. \nHe needed a million dollars to put the project across! Where was he to lay \nhis hands on so large a sum of money? That was the question that absorbed most \nof this ambitious young preacher's thought. \nBut he couldn't seem to make any progress.\nEvery night he took that thought to bed with him.

For nearly two years, I had been \nthinking, but I had done nothing but think! \n\"The time had come for ACTION! \n\"I made up my mind, then and there, that I would get the necessary \nmillion dollars within a week.

The main \nthing of importance was the decision to get the money within a specified time, \nand I want to tell you that the moment I reached a definite decision to get the \nmoney within a specified time, a strange feeling of assurance came over me, such \nas I had never before experienced.

I not only talked to my audience, but I fancy I talked also \nto God. I told what I would do with a million dollars if that amount were placed \nin my hands. I described the plan I had in mind for organizing a great \neducational institution, where young people would learn to do practical things, \nand at the same time develop their minds.\n\"When I had finished and sat down, a man slowly arose from his seat, \nabout three rows from the rear, and made his way toward the pulpit.

You will now be instructed \nhow to build plans which will be practical, viz:— \n(a) Ally yourself with a group of as many people as you may need for the \ncreation, and carrying out of your plan, or plans for the accumulation of money\n— making use of the \"Master Mind\" principle described in a later chapter. \n(Compliance with this instruction is absolutely essential. Do not neglect it.)\n(b) Before forming your \"Master Mind\" alliance, decide what advantages, \nand benefits, you may offer the individual members of your group, in return for \ntheir cooperation. No one will work indefinitely without some form of \ncompensation. No intelligent person will either request or expect another to \nwork without adequate compensation, although this may not always be in the \nform of money.\n(c) Arrange to meet with the members of your \"Master Mind\" group at \nleast twice a week, and more often if possible, until you have jointly perfected \nthe necessary plan, or plans for the accumulation of money. \nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover  How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n  www.think-and-grow-rich-ebook.com  \n100\n  THINK & GROW RICH   \n(d) Maintain PERFECT HARMONY between yourself and every member \nof your \"Master Mind\" group. If you fail to carry out this instruction to the letter, \nyou may expect to meet with failure. The \"Master Mind\" principle cannot obtain \nwhere PERFECT HARMONY does not prevail.\nKeep in mind these facts:— \nFirst. You are engaged in an undertaking of major importance to you. To be sure \nof success, you must have plans which are faultless.\nSecond. You must have the advantage of the experience, education, native ability \nand imagination of other minds. This is in harmony with the methods followed \nby every person who has accumulated a great fortune. \nNo individual has sufficient experience, education, native ability, and \nknowledge to insure the accumulation of a great fortune, without the \ncooperation of other people. Every plan you adopt, in your endeavor to \naccumulate wealth, should be the joint creation of yourself and every other \nmember of your \"Master Mind\" group. You may originate your own plans, either \nin whole or in part, but SEE THAT THOSE PLANS ARE CHECKED, AND \nAPPROVED BY THE MEMBERS OF YOUR \"MASTER MIND\" ALLIANCE. \nIf the first plan which you adopt does not work successfully, replace it \nwith a new plan, if this new plan fails to work, replace it, in turn with still \nanother, and so on, until you find a plan which DOES WORK. Right here is the \npoint at which the majority of men meet with failure, because of their lack of \nPERSISTENCE in creating new plans to take the place of those which fail.\nThe most intelligent man living cannot succeed in accumulating money— \nnor in any other undertaking— without plans which are practical and workable. \nJust keep this fact in mind, and remember when your plans fail, that temporary \ndefeat is not permanent failure.

The business depression forced Mr. Insull to CHANGE \nHIS PLANS; and the CHANGE brought \"temporary defeat,\" because his new \nplans were NOT SOUND. Mr. Insull is now an old man, he may, consequently, \naccept \"failure\" instead of \"temporary defeat,\" but if his experience turns out to \nbe FAILURE, it will be for the reason that he lacks the fire of PERSISTENCE to \nrebuild his plans.\nNo man is ever whipped, until he QUITS— in his own mind.\nThis fact will be repeated many times, because it is so easy to \"take the \ncount\" at the first sign of defeat.\nJames J.

One type is \nknown as LEADERS, and the other as FOLLOWERS. Decide at the outset \nwhether you intend to become a leader in your chosen calling, or remain a \nfollower. The difference in compensation is vast. The follower cannot reasonably \nexpect the compensation to which a leader is entitled, although many followers \nmake the mistake of expecting such pay. \nIt is no disgrace to be a follower. On the other hand, it is no credit to \nremain a follower. Most great leaders began in the capacity of followers. They \nbecame great leaders because they were INTELLIGENT FOLLOWERS. With few \nexceptions, the man who cannot follow a leader intelligently, cannot become an \nefficient leader. The man who can follow a leader most efficiently, is usually the \nman who develops into leadership most rapidly.

UNWAVERING COURAGE based upon knowledge of self, and of one's \noccupation. No follower wishes to be dominated by a leader who lacks self-\nconfidence and courage. No intelligent follower will be dominated by such a \nleader very long. \n2. SELF-CONTROL. The man who cannot control himself, can never \ncontrol others. Self-control sets a mighty example for one's followers, which the \nmore intelligent will emulate.\n3. A KEEN SENSE OF JUSTICE. Without a sense of fairness and justice, no \nleader can command and retain the respect of his followers. \n4. DEFINITENESS OF DECISION. The man who wavers in his decisions, \nshows that he is not sure of himself. He cannot lead others successfully.\n5. DEFINITENESS OF PLANS. The successful leader must plan his work, \nand work his plan. A leader who moves by guesswork, without practical, definite \nplans, is comparable to a ship without a rudder. Sooner or later he will land on \nthe rocks. \n6. THE HABIT OF DOING MORE THAN PAID FOR. One of the penalties \nof leadership is the necessity of willingness, upon the part of the leader, to do \nmore than he requires of his followers. \n7. A PLEASING PERSONALITY. No slovenly, careless person can become \na successful leader. Leadership calls for respect. Followers will not respect a \nleader who does not grade high on all of the factors of a Pleasing Personality. \n8. SYMPATHY AND UNDERSTANDING. The successful leader must be \nin sympathy with his followers. Moreover, he must understand them and their \nproblems.\n9. MASTERY OF DETAIL. Successful leadership calls for mastery of \ndetails of the leader's position. \nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover  How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n  www.think-and-grow-rich-ebook.com  \n104\n  THINK & GROW RICH   \n10. WILLINGNESS TO ASSUME FULL RESPONSIBILITY. The successful \nleader must be willing to assume responsibility for the mistakes and the \nshortcomings of his followers. If he tries to shift this responsibility, he will not \nremain the leader. If one of his followers makes a mistake, and shows himself \nincompetent, the leader must consider that it is he who failed. \n11. COOPERATION. The successful leader must understand, and apply \nthe principle of cooperative effort and be able to induce his followers to do the \nsame. Leadership calls for POWER, and power calls for COOPERATION. \nThere are two forms of Leadership. The first, and by far the most effective, \nis LEADERSHIP BY CONSENT of, and with the sympathy of the followers. The \nsecond is LEADERSHIP BY FORCE, without the consent and sympathy of the \nfollowers.\nHistory is filled with evidences that Leadership by Force cannot endure. \nThe downfall and disappearance of \"Dictators\" and kings is significant. It means \nthat people will not follow forced leadership indefinitely.\nThe world has just entered a new era of relationship between leaders and \nfollowers, which very clearly calls for new leaders, and a new brand of \nleadership in business and industry. Those who belong to the old school of \nleadership-by-force, must acquire an understanding of the new brand of \nleadership (cooperation) or be relegated to the rank and file of the followers. \nThere is no other way out for them.\nThe relationship of employer and employee, or of leader and follower, in \nthe future, will be one of mutual cooperation, based upon an equitable division \nof the profits of business. In the future, the relationship of employer and \nemployee will be more like a partnership than it has been in the past. \nNapoleon, Kaiser Wilhelm of Germany, the Czar of Russia, and the King \nof Spain were examples of leadership by force. Their leadership passed. Without \nmuch difficulty, one might point to the prototypes of these ex-leaders, among the \nbusiness, financial, and labor leaders of America who have been dethroned or \nslated to go. Leadership-by-consent of the followers is the only brand which can \nendure!\nMen may follow the forced leadership temporarily, but they will not do so \nwillingly.\nThe new brand of LEADERSHIP will embrace the eleven factors of \nleadership, described in this chapter, as well as some other factors.

The depression was prolonged, largely, because the world \nlacked LEADERSHIP of the new brand. At the end of the depression, the \ndemand for leaders who are competent to apply the new methods of leadership \nhas greatly exceeded the supply. Some of the old type of leaders will reform and \nadapt themselves to the new brand of leadership, but generally speaking, the \nworld will have to look for new timber for its leadership. This necessity may be \nyour OPPORTUNITY! \nTHE 10 MAJOR CAUSES OF FAILURE IN LEADERSHIP\nWe come now to the major faults of leaders who fail, because it is just as \nessential to know WHAT NOT TO DO as it is to know what to do.\n1. INABILITY TO ORGANIZE DETAILS. Efficient \nleadership calls for ability to organize and to master details. No \ngenuine leader is ever \"too busy\" to do anything which may be \nrequired of him in his capacity as leader. When a man, whether he \nis a leader or follower, admits that he is \"too busy\" to change his \nplans, or to give attention to any emergency, he admits his \ninefficiency. The successful leader must be the master of all details \nconnected with his position. That means, of course, that he must \nacquire the habit of relegating details to capable lieutenants. \n2. UNWILLINGNESS TO RENDER HUMBLE SERVICE. \nTruly great leaders are willing, when occasion demands, to perform \nany sort of labor which they would ask another to perform. \"The \ngreatest among ye shall be the servant of all\" is a truth which all \nable leaders observe and respect. \n3. EXPECTATION OF PAY FOR WHAT THEY \"KNOW\" \nINSTEAD OF WHAT THEY DO WITH THAT WHICH THEY \nKNOW. The world does not pay men for that which they \"know.\" It \npays them for what they DO, or induce others to do. \n4. FEAR OF COMPETITION FROM FOLLOWERS. The \nleader who fears that one of his followers may take his position is \nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover  How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n  www.think-and-grow-rich-ebook.com  \n106\n  THINK & GROW RICH   \npractically sure to realize that fear sooner or later. The able leader \ntrains understudies to whom he may delegate, at will, any of the \ndetails of his position. Only in this way may a leader multiply \nhimself and prepare himself to be at many places, and give \nattention to many things at one time. It is an eternal truth that men \nreceive more pay for their ABILITY TO GET OTHERS TO \nPERFORM, than they could possibly earn by their own efforts. An \nefficient leader may, through his knowledge of his job and the \nmagnetism of his personality, greatly increase the efficiency of \nothers, and induce them to render more service and better service \nthan they could render without his aid. \n5. LACK OF IMAGINATION. Without imagination, the \nleader is incapable of meeting emergencies, and of creating plans \nby which to guide his followers efficiently. \n6. SELFISHNESS. The leader who claims all the honor for the \nwork of his followers, is sure to be met by resentment. The really \ngreat leader CLAIMS NONE OF THE HONORS. He is contented to \nsee the honors, when there are any, go to his followers, because he \nknows that most men will work harder for commendation and \nrecognition than they will for money alone. \n7. INTEMPERANCE. Followers do not respect an \nintemperate leader. Moreover, intemperance in any of its various \nforms, destroys the endurance and the vitality of all who indulge in \nit. \n8. DISLOYALTY. Perhaps this should have come at the head \nof the list. The leader who is not loyal to his trust, and to his \nassociates, those above him, and those below him, cannot long \nmaintain his leadership. Disloyalty marks one as being less than the \ndust of the earth, and brings down on one's head the contempt he \ndeserves. Lack of loyalty is one of the major causes of failure in \nevery walk of life. \nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover  How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n  www.think-and-grow-rich-ebook.com  \n107\n  THINK & GROW RICH   \n9. EMPHASIS OF THE \"AUTHORITY\" OF LEADERSHIP. \nThe efficient leader leads by encouraging, and not by trying to instil \nfear in the hearts of his followers. The leader who tries to impress \nhis followers with his \"authority\" comes within the category of \nleadership through FORCE. If a leader is a REAL LEADER, he will \nhave no need to advertise that fact except by his conduct— his \nsympathy, understanding, fairness, and a demonstration that he \nknows his job. \n10. EMPHASIS OF TITLE. The competent leader requires no \n\"title\" to give him the respect of his followers. The man who makes \ntoo much over his title generally has little else to emphasize. The \ndoors to the office of the real leader are open to all who wish to \nenter, and his working quarters are free from formality or \nostentation. \nThese are among the more common of the causes of failure in leadership. \nAny one of these faults is sufficient to induce failure. Study the list carefully if \nyou aspire to leadership, and make sure that you are free of these faults. \nSOME FERTILE FIELDS IN WHICH \"NEW LEADERSHIP\" WILL \nBE REQUIRED\nBefore leaving this chapter, your attention is called to a few of the fertile \nfields in which there has been a decline of leadership, and in which the new type \nof leader may find an abundance of OPPORTUNITY.\nFirst. In the field of politics there is a most insistent demand \nfor new leaders; a demand which indicates nothing less than an \nemergency. The majority of politicians have, seemingly, become \nhigh-grade, legalized racketeers. They have increased taxes and \ndebauched the machinery of industry and business until the people \ncan no longer stand the burden. \nSecond. The banking business is undergoing a reform. The \nleaders in this field have almost entirely lost the confidence of the \nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover  How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n  www.think-and-grow-rich-ebook.com  \n108\n  THINK & GROW RICH   \npublic. Already the bankers have sensed the need of reform, and \nthey have begun it. \nThird. Industry calls for new leaders. The old type of leaders \nthought and moved in terms of dividends instead of thinking and \nmoving in terms of human equations! The future leader in industry, \nto endure, must regard himself as a quasi-public official whose \nduty it is to manage his trust in such a way that it will work \nhardship on no individual, or group of individuals. Exploitation of \nworking men is a thing of the past. Let the man who aspires to \nleadership in the field of business, industry, and labor remember \nthis. \nFourth. The religious leader of the future will be forced to \ngive more attention to the temporal needs of his followers, in the \nsolution of their economic and personal problems of the present, \nand less attention to the dead past, and the yet unborn future. \nFifth. In the professions of law, medicine, and education, a \nnew brand of leadership, and to some extent, new leaders will \nbecome a necessity. This is especially true in the field of education. \nThe leader in that field must, in the future, find ways and means of \nteaching people HOW TO APPLY the knowledge they receive in \nschool. He must deal more with PRACTICE and less with \nTHEORY. \nSixth. New leaders will be required in the field of \nJournalism. Newspapers of the future, to be conducted \nsuccessfully, must be divorced from \"special privilege\" and relieved \nfrom the subsidy of advertising. They must cease to be organs of \npropaganda for the interests which patronize their advertising \ncolumns. The type of newspaper which publishes scandal and lewd \npictures will eventually go the way of all forces which debauch the \nhuman mind. \nThese are but a few of the fields in which opportunities for new leaders \nand a new brand of leadership are now available.

This means that the media through which the changes in human \nhabits are promoted, must be adapted to the changes. The media here described, \nare the ones which, more than any others, determine the trend of civilization. \nWHEN AND HOW TO APPLY FOR A POSITION\nThe information described here is the net result of many years of \nexperience during which thousands of men and women were helped to market \ntheir services effectively. It can, therefore, be relied upon as sound and practical. \nMEDIA THROUGH WHICH SERVICES MAY BE \nMARKETED\nExperience has proved that the following media offer the most direct and \neffective methods of bringing the buyer and seller of personal services together.\n1. EMPLOYMENT BUREAUS. Care must be taken to select only reputable \nbureaus, the management of which can show adequate records of achievement of \nsatisfactory results. There are comparatively few such bureaus. \n2. ADVERTISING in newspapers, trade journals, magazines, and radio. \nClassified advertising may usually be relied upon to produce satisfactory results \nin the case of those who apply for clerical or ordinary salaried positions. Display \nadvertising is more desirable in the case of those who seek executive connections, \nthe copy to appear in the section of the paper which is most apt to come to the \nattention of the class of employer being sought. The copy should be prepared by \nan expert, who understands how to inject sufficient selling qualities to produce \nreplies. \n3. PERSONAL LETTERS OF APPLICATION, directed to particular firms \nor individuals most apt to need such services as are being offered. Letters should \nbe neatly typed, ALWAYS, and signed by hand. With the letter, should be sent a \ncomplete \"brief\" or outline of the applicant's qualifications. Both the letter of \napplication and the brief of experience or qualifications should be prepared by an \nexpert.

APPLICATION THROUGH PERSONAL ACQUAINTANCES. When \npossible, the applicant should endeavor to approach prospective employers \nthrough some mutual acquaintance. This method of approach is particularly \nadvantageous in the case of those who seek executive connections and do not \nwish to appear to be \"peddling\" themselves. \n5. APPLICATION IN PERSON. In some instances, it may be more \neffective if the applicant offers personally, his services to prospective employers, \nin which event a complete written statement of qualifications for the position \nshould be presented, for the reason that prospective employers often wish to \ndiscuss with associates, one's record. \nINFORMATION TO BE SUPPLIED IN A WRITTEN \"BRIEF\"\nThis brief should be prepared as carefully as a lawyer would prepare the \nbrief of a case to be tried m court. Unless the applicant is experienced in the \npreparation of such briefs, an expert should be consulted, and his services \nenlisted for this purpose. Successful merchants employ men and women who \nunderstand the art and the psychology of advertising to present the merits of \ntheir merchandise. One who has personal services for sale should do the same. \nThe following information should appear in the brief: \n1. Education. State briefly, but definitely, what schooling you have had, \nand in what subjects you specialized in school, giving the reasons for that \nspecialization. \n2. Experience. If you have had experience in connection with positions \nsimilar to the one you seek, describe it fully, state names and addresses of former \nemployers. Be sure to bring out clearly any special experience you may have had \nwhich would equip you to fill the position you seek.\n3. References. Practically every business firm desires to know all about the \nprevious records, antecedents, etc., of prospective employees who seek positions \nof responsibility.

Prominent people whose judgement may be relied upon. \n4. Photograph of self. Attach to your brief a recent, unmounted photograph \nof yourself. \n5. Apply for a specific position. Avoid application for a position without \ndescribing EXACTLY what particular position you seek. Never apply for \"just a \nposition.\" That indicates you lack specialized qualifications. \n6. State your qualifications for the particular position for which you apply. \nGive full details as to the reason you believe you are qualified for the particular \nposition you seek. This is THE APPLICATION. It will determine, more than \nanything else, what consideration you receive.\n7. Offer to go to work on probation. In the majority of instances if you are \ndetermined to have the position for which you apply, it will be most effective if \nyou offer to work for a week, or a month, or for a sufficient length of time to \nenable your prospective employer to judge your value WITHOUT PAY. This \nmay appear to be a radical suggestion, but experience has proved that it seldom \nfails to win at least a trial. If you are SURE OF YOUR QUALIFICATIONS, a trial \nis all you need. Incidentally, such an offer indicates that you have confidence in \nyour ability to fill the position you seek. It is most convincing. If your offer is \naccepted, and you make good, more than likely you will be paid for your \n\"probation\" period. Make clear the fact that your offer is based upon: \na. Your confidence in your ability to fill the position.\nb. Your confidence in your prospective employer's decision \nto employ you after trial.\nc. Your DETERMINATION to have the position you seek. \n8. Knowledge of your prospective employer's business. Before applying for a \nposition, do sufficient research in connection with the business to familiarize \nyourself thoroughly with that business, and indicate in your brief the knowledge \nyou have acquired in this field. This will be impressive, as it will indicate that \nyou have imagination, and a real interest in the position you seek.\nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover  How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n  www.think-and-grow-rich-ebook.com  \n112\n  THINK & GROW RICH   \nRemember that it is not the lawyer who knows the most law, but the one \nwho best prepares his case, who wins. If your \"case\" is properly prepared and \npresented, your victory will have been more than half won at the outset.\nDo not be afraid of making your brief too long. Employers are just as \nmuch interested in purchasing the services of well-qualified applicants as you are \nin securing employment. In fact, the success of most successful employers is due, \nin the main, to their ability to select well-qualified lieutenants. They want all the \ninformation available.\nRemember another thing; neatness in the preparation of your brief will \nindicate that you are a painstaking person. I have helped to prepare briefs for \nclients which were so striking and out of the ordinary that they resulted in the \nemployment of the applicant without a personal interview. \nWhen your brief has been completed, have it neatly bound by an \nexperienced binder, and lettered by an artist, or printer similar to the following: \nBRIEF OF THE QUALIFICATIONS OF\nRobert K. Smith\nAPPLYING FOR THE POSITION OF\nPrivate Secretary to The President of\nTHE BLANK COMPANY, Inc.\nChange names each time brief is shown. \nThis personal touch is sure to command attention. Have your brief neatly \ntyped or mimeographed on the finest paper you can obtain, and bound with a \nheavy paper of the book-cover variety, the binder to be changed, and the proper \nfirm name to be inserted if it is to be shown to more than one company. Your \nphotograph should be pasted on one of the pages of your brief. Follow these \ninstructions to the letter, improving upon them wherever your imagination \nsuggests. \nSuccessful salesmen groom themselves with care. They understand that \nfirst impressions are lasting. Your brief is your salesman. Give it a good suit of \nclothes, so it will stand out in bold contrast to anything your prospective \nemployer ever saw, in the way of an application for a position. If the position you \nseek is worth having, it is worth going after with care. Moreover, if you sell \nyourself to an employer in a manner that impresses him with your individuality, \nyou probably will receive more money for your services from the very start, than \nyou would if you applied for employment in the usual conventional way.\nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover  How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n  www.think-and-grow-rich-ebook.com  \n113\n  THINK & GROW RICH   \nIf you seek employment through an advertising agency, or an \nemployment agency, have the agent use copies of your brief in marketing your \nservices.

If the job doesn't \nalready exist, perhaps you can create it.\nSecond. Choose the company, or individual for whom you wish to work. \nThird. Study your prospective employer, as to policies, personnel, and \nchances of advancement. \nFourth. By analysis of yourself, your talents and capabilities, figure \nWHAT YOU CAN OFFER, and plan ways and means of giving advantages, \nservices, developments, ideas that you believe you can successfully deliver. \nFifth. Forget about \"a job.\" Forget whether or not there is an opening. \nForget the usual routine of \"have you got a job for me?\" Concentrate on what you \ncan give. \nSixth.

Who does not \nremember the day when, if a citizen enquired at the ticket office, the time of \ndeparture of a train, he was abruptly referred to the bulletin board instead of \nbeing politely given the information? \nThe street car companies have experienced a \"change of times\" also. There \nwas a time not so very long ago when street car conductors took pride in giving \nargument to passengers. Many of the street car tracks have been removed and \npassengers ride on a bus, whose driver is \"the last word in politeness.\" \nAll over the country street car tracks are rusting from abandonment, or \nhave been taken up. Whereever street cars are still in operation, passengers may \nnow ride without argument, and one may even hail the car in the middle of the \nblock, and the motorman will OBLIGINGLY pick him up. \nHOW TIMES HAVE CHANGED! That is just the point I am trying to \nemphasize. TIMES HAVE CHANGED! Moreover, the change is reflected not \nmerely in railroad offices and on street cars, but in other walks of life as well. The \n\"public-be-damned\" policy is now passé. It has been supplanted by the \"we-are-\nobligingly-at-your-service, sir,\" policy. \nThe bankers have learned a thing or two during this rapid change which \nhas taken place during the past few years. Impoliteness on the part of a bank \nofficial, or bank employee today is as rare as it was conspicuous a dozen years \nago. In the years past, some bankers (not all of them, of course), carried an \natmosphere of austerity which gave every would-be borrower a chill when he \neven thought of approaching his banker for a loan. \nThe thousands of bank failures during the depression had the effect of \nremoving the mahogany doors behind which bankers formerly barricaded \nthemselves. They now sit at desks in the open, where they may be seen and \napproached at will by any depositor, or by anyone who wishes to see them, and \nthe whole atmosphere of the bank is one of courtesy and understanding. \nIt used to be customary for customers to have to stand and wait at the \ncorner grocery until the clerks were through passing the time of day with friends, \nand the proprietor had finished making up his bank deposit, before being waited \nupon.

The meter-man \nnow conducts himself as a gentleman who is \"delighted-to-be-at-your-service- \nsir.\" Before the gas companies learned that their scowling meter-men were \naccumulating liabilities never to be cleared away, the polite salesmen of oil \nburners came along and did a land office business.\nDuring the depression, I spent several months in the anthracite coal region \nof Pennsylvania, studying conditions which all but destroyed the coal industry. \nAmong several very significant discoveries, was the fact that greed on the part of \noperators and their employees was the chief cause of the loss of business for the \noperators, and loss of jobs for the miners.\nThrough the pressure of a group of overzealous labor leaders, \nrepresenting the employees, and the greed for profits on the part of the \noperators, the anthracite business suddenly dwindled. The coal operators and \ntheir employees drove sharp bargains with one another, adding the cost of the \n\"bargaining\" to the price of the coal, until, finally, they discovered they had \nBUILT UP A WONDERFUL BUSINESS FOR THE MANUFACTURERS OF OIL \nBURNING OUTFITS AND THE PRODUCERS OF CRUDE OIL. \n\"The wages of sin is death!\" Many have read this in the Bible, but few have \ndiscovered its meaning.

Nothing ever happens \nwithout a CAUSE. In the main, the cause of the depression is traceable directly to \nthe worldwide habit of trying to REAP without SOWING. \nThis should not be mistaken to mean that the depression represents a crop \nwhich the world is being FORCED to reap without having SOWN.

If there is a principle of cause and effect, which controls \nbusiness, finance, and transportation, this same principle controls individuals \nand determines their economic status. \nWHAT IS YOUR \"QQS\" RATING?\nThe causes of success in marketing services EFFECTIVELY and \npermanently, have been clearly described. Unless those causes are studied, \nanalyzed, understood and APPLIED, no man can market his services effectively \nand permanently. Every person must be his own salesman of personal services. \nThe QUALITY and the QUANTITY of service rendered, and the SPIRIT in which \nit is rendered, determine to a large extent, the price, and the duration of \nemployment. To market Personal services effectively, (which means a permanent \nmarket, at a satisfactory price, under pleasant conditions), one must adopt and \nfollow the \"QQS\" formula which means that QUALITY, plus QUANTITY, plus \nthe proper SPIRIT of cooperation, equals perfect salesmanship of service. \nRemember the \"QQS\" formula, but do more—APPLY IT AS A HABIT! \nLet us analyze the formula to make sure we understand exactly what it \nmeans. \n1. QUALITY of service shall be construed to mean the performance of \nevery detail, in connection with your position, in the most efficient manner \npossible, with the object of greater efficiency always in mind.\n2. QUANTITY of service shall be understood to mean the HABIT of \nrendering all the service of which you are capable, at all times, with the purpose \nof increasing the amount of service rendered as greater skill is developed \nthrough practice and experience. Emphasis is again placed on the word HABIT. \n3. SPIRIT of service shall be construed to mean the HABIT of agreeable, \narmonious conduct which will induce cooperation from associates and fellow \nemployees. \nAdequacy of QUALITY and QUANTITY of service is not sufficient to \nmaintain a permanent market for your services.

He emphasized again, and again, the necessity for HARMONIOUS \nCONDUCT. He stressed the fact that he would not retain any man, no matter \nhow great a QUANTITY, or how efficient the QUALITY of his work, unless he \nworked in a spirit of HARMONY. Mr. Carnegie insisted upon men being \nAGREEABLE.\nTo prove that he placed a high value upon this quality, he permitted many \nmen who conformed to his standards to become very wealthy. Those who did not \nconform, had to make room for others.\nThe importance of a pleasing personality has been stressed, because it is a \nfactor which enables one to render service in the proper SPIRIT. If one has a \npersonality which PLEASES, and renders service in a spirit of HARMONY, these \nassets often make up for deficiencies in both the QUALITY, and the QUANTITY \nof service one renders. Nothing, however, can be SUCCESSFULLY \nSUBSTITUTED FOR PLEASING CONDUCT. \nTHE CAPITAL VALUE OF YOUR SERVICES\nThe person whose income is derived entirely from the sale of personal \nservices is no less a merchant than the man who sells commodities, and it might \nwell be added, such a person is subject to EXACTLY THE SAME RULES of \nconduct as the merchant who sells merchandise. \nThis has been emphasized, because the majority of people who live by the \nsale of personal services make the mistake of considering themselves free from \nthe rules of conduct, and the responsibilities attached to those who are engaged \nin marketing commodities. \nThe new way of marketing services has practically forced both employer \nand. employee into partnership alliances, through which both take into \nconsideration the rights of the third party, THE PUBLIC THEY SERVE.\nThe day of the \"go-getter\" has passed.

There will \nnever be the need to put the lid back on, because, in the future, business will be \nconducted by methods that will require no pressure. \nThe actual capital value of your brains may be determined by the amount \nof income you can produce (by marketing your services).

Moreover, the money which is essential for the conduct of \nbusiness is as worthless as a sand dune, until it has been mixed with efficient \n\"brains.\" \nTHE THIRTY MAJOR CAUSES OF FAILURE \nHOW MANY OF THESE ARE HOLDING YOU BACK?\nLife's greatest tragedy consists of men and women who earnestly try, and \nfail! The tragedy lies in the overwhelmingly large majority of people who fail, as \ncompared to the few who succeed. \nI have had the privilege of analyzing several thousand men and women, \n98% of whom were classed as \"failures.\" There is something radically wrong with \na civilization, and a system of education, which permit 98% of the people to go \nthrough life as failures.

LACK OF AMBITION TO AIM ABOVE MEDIOCRITY. \nWe offer no hope for the person who is so indifferent as not to want \nto get ahead in life, and who is not willing to pay the price.\n4. INSUFFICIENT EDUCATION. This is a handicap which \nmay be overcome with comparative ease. Experience has proven \nthat the best-educated people are often those who are known as \n\"self-made,\" or self-educated. It takes more than a college degree to \nmake one a person of education. Any person who is educated is \none who has learned to get whatever he wants in life without \nviolating the rights of others. Education consists, not so much of \nknowledge, but of knowledge effectively and persistently \nAPPLIED. Men are paid, not merely for what they know, but more \nparticularly for WHAT THEY DO WITH THAT WHICH THEY \nKNOW. \n5. LACK OF SELF-DISCIPLINE. Discipline comes through \nself-control. This means that one must control all negative qualities. \nBefore you can control conditions, you must first control yourself. \nSelf-mastery is the hardest job you will ever tackle. If you do not \nconquer self, you will be conquered by self. You may see at one and \nthe same time both your best friend and your greatest enemy, by \nstepping in front of a mirror.\n6. ILL HEALTH. No person may enjoy outstanding success \nwithout good health. Many of the causes of ill health are subject to \nmastery and control. These, in the main are: \na. Overeating of foods not conducive to health\nb. Wrong habits of thought; giving expression to \nnegatives. \nc. Wrong use of, and over indulgence in sex. \nd. Lack of proper physical exercise \ne. An inadequate supply of fresh air, due to improper \nbreathing.\nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover  How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n  www.think-and-grow-rich-ebook.com  \n121\n  THINK & GROW RICH   \n7. UNFAVORABLE ENVIRONMENTAL INFLUENCES \nDURING CHILDHOOD. \"As the twig is bent, so shall the tree \ngrow.\" Most people who have criminal tendencies acquire them as \nthe result of bad environment, and improper associates during \nchildhood. \n8. PROCRASTINATION. This is one of the most common \ncauses of failure. \"Old Man Procrastination\" stands within the \nshadow of every human being, waiting his opportunity to spoil \none's chances of success. Most of us go through life as failures, \nbecause we are waiting for the \"time to be right\" to start doing \nsomething worthwhile. Do not wait. The time will never be \"just \nright.\" Start where you stand, and work with whatever tools you \nmay have at your command, and better tools will be found as you \ngo along.\n9. LACK OF PERSISTENCE. Most of us are good \"starters\" \nbut poor \"finishers\" of everything we begin. Moreover, people are \nprone to give up at the first signs of defeat. There is no substitute \nfor PERSISTENCE. The person who makes PERSISTENCE his \nwatch-word, discovers that \"Old Man Failure\" finally becomes \ntired, and makes his departure. Failure cannot cope with \nPERSISTENCE. \n10. NEGATIVE PERSONALITY. There is no hope of success \nfor the person who repels people through a negative personality. \nSuccess comes through the application of POWER, and power is \nattained through the cooperative efforts of other people. A negative \npersonality will not induce cooperation.\n11. LACK OF CONTROLLED SEXUAL URGE. Sex energy is \nthe most powerful of all the stimuli which move people into \nACTION. Because it is the most powerful of the emotions, it must \nbe controlled, through transmutation, and converted into other \nchannels.\n12. UNCONTROLLED DESIRE FOR \"SOMETHING FOR \nNOTHING.\" The gambling instinct drives millions of people to \nfailure. Evidence of this may be found in a study of the Wall Street \ncrash of '29, during which millions of people tried to make money \nby gambling on stock margins. \nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover  How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n  www.think-and-grow-rich-ebook.com  \n122\n  THINK & GROW RICH   \n13. LACK OF A WELL DEFINED POWER OF DECISION. \nMen who succeed reach decisions promptly, and change them, if at \nall, very slowly. Men who fail, reach decisions, if at all, very slowly, \nand change them frequently, and quickly. Indecision and \nprocrastination are twin brothers. Where one is found, the other \nmay usually be found also. Kill off this pair before they completely \n\"hog-tie\" you to the treadmill of FAILURE. \n14. ONE OR MORE OF THE SIX BASIC FEARS. These fears \nhave been analyzed for you in a later chapter. They must be \nmastered before you can market your services effectively. \n15. WRONG SELECTION OF A MATE IN MARRIAGE. This \na most common cause of failure. The relationship of marriage \nbrings people intimately into contact. Unless this relationship is \nharmonious, failure is likely to follow. Moreover, it will be a form \nof failure that is marked by misery and unhappiness, destroying all \nsigns of AMBITION. \n16. OVER-CAUTION. The person who takes no chances, \ngenerally has to take whatever is left when others are through \nchoosing. Over-caution is as bad as under-caution. Both are \nextremes to be guarded against. Life itself is filled with the element \nof chance. \n17. WRONG SELECTION OF ASSOCIATES IN BUSINESS. \nThis is one of the most common causes of failure in business. In \nmarketing personal services, one should use great care to select an \nemployer who will be an inspiration, and who is, himself, \nintelligent and successful. We emulate those with whom we \nassociate most closely. Pick an employer who is worth emulating. \n18. SUPERSTITION AND PREJUDICE. Superstition is a \nform of fear. It is also a sign of ignorance. Men who succeed keep \nopen minds and are afraid of nothing. \n19. WRONG SELECTION OF A VOCATION. No man can \nsucceed in a line of endeavor which he does not like. The most \nessential step in the marketing of personal services is that of \nselecting an occupation into which you can throw yourself \nwholeheartedly.\nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover  How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n  www.think-and-grow-rich-ebook.com  \n123\n  THINK & GROW RICH   \n20. LACK OF CONCENTRATION OF EFFORT. The \"jack-of-\nall-trades\" seldom is good at any. Concentrate all of your efforts on \none DEFINITE CHIEF AIM. \n21. THE HABIT OF INDISCRIMINATE SPENDING. The \nspend-thrift cannot succeed, mainly because he stands eternally in \nFEAR OF POVERTY. Form the habit of systematic saving by \nputting aside a definite percentage of your income. Money in the \nbank gives one a very safe foundation of COURAGE when bar-\ngaining for the sale of personal services. Without money, one must \ntake what one is offered, and be glad to get it. \n22. LACK OF ENTHUSIASM. Without enthusiasm one \ncannot be convincing. Moreover, enthusiasm is contagious, and the \nperson who has it, under control, is generally welcome in any \ngroup of people.\n23. INTOLERANCE. The person with a \"closed\" mmd on \nany subject seldom gets ahead. Intolerance means that one has \nstopped acquiring knowledge. The most damaging forms of \nintolerance are those connected with religious, racial, and political \ndifferences of opinion.\n24. INTEMPERANCE. The most damaging forms of \nintemperance are connected with eating, strong drink, and sexual \nactivities. Overindulgence in any of these is fatal to success. \n25. INABILITY TO COOPERATE WITH OTHERS. More \npeople lose their positions and their big opportunities in life, \nbecause of this fault, than for all other reasons combined. It is a \nfault which no well-informed business man, or leader will tolerate. \n26. POSSESSION OF POWER THAT WAS NOT ACQUIRED \nTHROUGH SELF EFFORT. (Sons and daughters of wealthy men, \nand others who inherit money which they did not earn). Power in \nthe hands of one who did not acquire it gradually, is often fatal to \nsuccess. QUICK RICHES are more dangerous than poverty. \n27. INTENTIONAL DISHONESTY. There is no substitute for \nhonesty. One may be temporarily dishonest by force of \ncircumstances over which one has no control, without permanent \ndamage. But, there is NO HOPE for the person who is dishonest by \nchoice. Sooner or later, his deeds will catch up with him, and he \nwill pay by loss of reputation, and perhaps even loss of liberty. \nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover  How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n  www.think-and-grow-rich-ebook.com  \n124\n  THINK & GROW RICH   \n28. EGOTISM AND VANITY. These qualities serve as red \nlights which warn others to keep away. THEY ARE FATAL TO \nSUCCESS. \n29. GUESSING INSTEAD OF THINKING. Most people are \ntoo indifferent or lazy to acquire FACTS with which to THINK \nACCURATELY. They prefer to act on \"opinions\" created by \nguesswork or snap-judgments. \n30. LACK OF CAPITAL. This is a common cause of failure \namong those who start out in business for the first time, without \nsufficient reserve of capital to absorb the shock of their mistakes, \nand to carry them over until they have established a \nREPUTATION. \n31. Under this, name any particular cause of failure from \nwhich you have suffered that has not been included in the \nforegoing list. \nIn these thirty major causes of failure is found a description of the tragedy \nof life, which obtains for practically every person who tries and fails. It will be \nhelpful if you can induce someone who knows you well to go over this list with \nyou, and help to analyze you by the thirty causes of failure. It may be beneficial if \nyou try this alone. Most people cannot see themselves as others see them. You \nmay be one who cannot.\nThe oldest of admonitions is \"Man, know thyself!\" If you market \nmerchandise successfully, you must know the merchandise. The same is true in \nmarketing personal services. You should know all of your weaknesses in order \nthat you may either bridge them or eliminate them entirely. You should know \nyour strength in order that you may call attention to it when selling your \nservices. You can know yourself only through accurate analysis.\nThe folly of ignorance in connection with self was displayed by a young \nman who applied to the manager of a well known business for a position. He \nmade a very good impression until the manager asked him what salary he \nexpected. He replied that he had no fixed sum in mind (lack of a definite aim). The \nmanager then said, \"We will pay you all you are worth, alter we try you out for a \nweek.\"\n\"I will not accept it,\" the applicant replied, \"because I AM GETTING \nMORE THAN THAT WHERE I AM NOW EMPLOYED.\"\nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover  How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n  www.think-and-grow-rich-ebook.com  \n125\n  THINK & GROW RICH   \nBefore you even start to negotiate for a readjustment of your salary in \nyour present position, or to seek employment elsewhere, BE SURE THAT YOU \nARE WORTH MORE THAN YOU NOW RECEIVE.\nIt is one thing to WANT money— everyone wants more—but it is \nsomething entirely different to be WORTH MORE! Many people mistake their \nWANTS for their JUST DUES. Your financial requirements or wants have \nnothing whatever to do with your WORTH. Your value is established entirely by \nyour ability to render useful service or your capacity to induce others to render \nsuch service. \nTAKE INVENTORY OF YOURSELF\n28 QUESTIONS YOU SHOULD ANSWER\nAnnual self-analysis is an essential in the effective marketing of personal \nservices, as is annual inventory in merchandising. Moreover, the yearly analysis \nshould disclose a DECREASE IN FAULTS, and an increase in VIRTUES. One \ngoes ahead, stands still, or goes backward in life. One's object should be, of \ncourse, to go ahead. Annual self-analysis will disclose whether advancement has \nbeen, made, and if so, how much. It will also disclose any backward steps one \nmay have made. The effective marketing of personal services requires one to \nmove forward even if the progress is slow.\nYour annual self-analysis should be made at the end of each year, so you \ncan include in your New Year's Resolutions any improvements which the \nanalysis indicates should be made.

Most of us have never taken inventory of the advantages of \nthis freedom. We have never compared our unlimited freedom with the curtailed \nfreedom in other countries. \nHere we have freedom of thought, freedom in the choice and enjoyment of \neducation, freedom in religion, freedom in politics, freedom in the choice of a \nbusiness, profession or occupation, freedom to accumulate and own without \nmolestation, ALL \nTHE PROPERTY WE CAN ACCUMULATE, freedom to choose our place \nof residence, freedom in marriage, freedom through equal opportunity to all \nraces, freedom of travel from one state to another, freedom in our choice of foods, \nand freedom \nto AIM FOR ANY STATION IN LIFE FOR WHICH WE HAVE PREPARED  \nOURSELVES, even for the presidency of the United States. \nWe have other forms of freedom, but this list will give a bird's eye view of \nthe most important, which constitute OPPORTUNITY of the highest order. This \nadvantage of freedom is all the more conspicuous because the United States is \nthe only country guaranteeing to every citizen, whether native born or \nnaturalized, so broad and varied a list of freedom. \nNext, let us recount some of the blessings which our widespread freedom \nhas placed within our hands. Take the average American family for example \n(meaning, the family of average income) and sum up the benefits available to \nevery member of the family, in this land of OPPORTUNITY and plenty! \nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover  How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n  www.think-and-grow-rich-ebook.com  \n129\n  THINK & GROW RICH   \na. FOOD. Next to freedom of thought and deed comes FOOD, \nCLOTHING, and SHELTER, the three basic necessities of life. \nBecause of our universal freedom the average American family has \navailable, at its very door, the choicest selection of food to be found \nanywhere in the world, and at prices within its financial range.\nA family of two, living in the heart of Times Square district of New \nYork City, far removed from the source of production of foods, took \ncareful inventory of the cost of a simple breakfast, with this astonishing \nresult: \nArticles of food; \nCost at the breakfast table: \nGrape Fruit Juice, (From Florida) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  . 02 \nRippled Wheat Breakfast food (Kansas Farm). . . . . . . . . 02 \nTea (From China). . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 02 \nBananas (From South America) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .02½ \nToasted Bread (From Kansas Farm) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .01 \nFresh Country Eggs (From Utah) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .07 \nSugar (From Cuba, or Utah) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 00½ \nButter and Cream (From New England) . . . . . . . . . . . . .03 \nGrand total . . . . . .20 \nIt is not very difficult to obtain FOOD in a country where two people can \nhave breakfast consisting of all they want or need for a dime apiece! Observe that \nthis simple breakfast was gathered, by some strange form of magic (?) from \nChina, South America, Utah, Kansas and the New England States, and delivered \non the breakfast table, ready for consumption, in the very heart of the most \ncrowded city in America, at a cost well within the means of the most humble \nlaborer. \nThe cost included all federal, state and city taxes! (Here is a fact the \npoliticians did not mention when they were crying out to the voters to throw \ntheir opponents out of office because the people were being taxed to death). \nb. SHELTER. This family lives in a comfortable apartment, heated \nby steam, lighted with electricity, with gas for cooking, all for $65.00 a \nmonth. In a smaller city, or a more sparsely settled part of New York city, \nthe same apartment could be had for as low as $20.00 a month.\nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover  How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n  www.think-and-grow-rich-ebook.com  \n130\n  THINK & GROW RICH   \nThe toast they had for breakfast in the food estimate was toasted on \nan electric toaster, which cost but a few dollars, the apartment is cleaned \nwith a vacuum sweeper that is run by electricity.

The wife curls her hair, \nwashes her clothes and irons them with easily operated electrical \nequipment, on power obtained by sticking a plug in the wall. The husband \nshaves with an electric shaver, and they receive entertainment from all \nover the world, twenty four hours a day, if they want it, without cost, by \nmerely turning the dial of their radio.\nThere are other conveniences in this apartment, but the foregoing \nlist will give a fair idea of some of the concrete evidences of the freedom \nwe, of America, enjoy. (And this is neither political nor economic \npropaganda).\nc. CLOTHING. Anywhere in the United States, the woman of \naverage clothing requirements can dress very comfortably and neatly for \nless than $200.00 a year, and the average man can dress for the same, or \nless. \nOnly the three basic necessities of food, clothing, and shelter have been \nmentioned. The average American citizen has other privileges and advantages \navailable in return for modest effort, not exceeding eight hours per day of labor. \nAmong these is the privilege of automobile transportation, with which one can \ngo and come at will, at very small cost.\nThe average American has security of property rights not found in any \nother country in the world. He can place his surplus money in a bank with the \nassurance that his government will protect it, and make good to him if the bank \nfails. If an American citizen wants to travel from one state to another he needs no \npassport, no one's permission. He may go when he pleases, and return at will. \nMoreover, he may travel by train, private automobile, bus, airplane, or ship, as \nhis pocketbook permits. In Germany, Russia, Italy, and most of the other \nEuropean and Oriental countries, the people cannot travel with so much \nfreedom, and at so little cost. \nTHE \"MIRACLE\" THAT HAS PROVIDED \nTHESE BLESSINGS\nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover  How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n  www.think-and-grow-rich-ebook.com  \n131\n  THINK & GROW RICH   \nWe often hear politicians proclaiming the freedom of America, when they \nsolicit votes, but seldom do they take the time or devote sufficient effort to the \nanalysis of the source or nature of this \"freedom.\" Having no axe to grind, no \ngrudge to express, no ulterior motives to be carried out, I have the privilege of \ngoing into a frank analysis of that mysterious, abstract, greatly misunderstood \n\"SOMETHING\" which gives to every citizen of America more blessings, more \nopportunities to accumulate wealth, more freedom of every nature, than may be \nfound in any other country.\nI have the right to analyze the source and nature of this UNSEEN POWER, \nbecause I know, and have known for more than a quarter of a century, many of \nthe men who organized that power, and many who are now responsible for its \nmaintenance. \nThe name of this mysterious benefactor of mankind is CAPITAL! \nCAPITAL consists not alone of money, but more particularly of highly \norganized, intelligent groups of men who plan ways and means of using money \nefficiently for the good of the public, and profitably to themselves. \nThese groups consist of scientists, educators, chemists, inventors, business \nanalysts, publicity men, transportation experts, accountants, lawyers, doctors, \nand both men and women who have highly specialized knowledge in all fields of \nindustry and business. They pioneer, experiment, and blaze trails in new fields of \nendeavor. They support colleges, hospitals, public schools, build good roads, \npublish newspapers, pay most of the cost of government, and take care of the \nmultitudinous detail essential to human progress. Stated briefly, the capitalists \nare the brains of civilization, because they supply the entire fabric of which all \neducation, enlightenment and human progress consists.\nMoney, without brains, always is dangerous. Properly used, it is the most \nimportant essential of civilization. The simple breakfast here described could not \nhave been delivered to the New York family at a dime each, or at any other price, if \norganized capital had not provided the machinery, the ships, the railroads, and \nthe huge armies of trained men to operate them. \nSome slight idea of the importance of ORGANIZED CAPITAL may be \nhad by trying to imagine yourself burdened with the responsibility of collecting, \nwithout the aid of capital, and delivering to the New York City family, the \nsimple breakfast described. \nTo supply the tea, you would have to make a trip to China or India, both a \nvery long way from America.

Then, too, another problem \nwould confront you. What would you use for money, even if you had the \nphysical endurance to swim the ocean? \nTo supply the sugar, you would have to take another long swim to Cuba, \nor a long walk to the sugar beet section of Utah. But even then, you might come \nback without the sugar, because organized effort and money are necessary to \nproduce sugar, to say nothing of what is required to refine, transport, and deliver \nit to the breakfast table anywhere in the United States.\nThe eggs, you could deliver easily enough from the barn yards near New \nYork City, but you would have a very long walk to Florida and return, before \nyou could serve the two glasses of grapefruit juice. \nYou would have another long walk, to Kansas, or one of the other wheat \ngrowing states, when you went after the four slices of wheat bread. \nThe Rippled Wheat Biscuits would have to be omitted from the menu, \nbecause they would not be available except through the labor of a trained \norganization of men and suitable machinery, ALL OF WHICH CALL FOR \nCAPITAL. \nWhile resting, you could take off for another little swim down to South \nAmerica, where you would pick up a couple of bananas, and on your return, you \ncould take a short walk to the nearest farm having a dairy and pick up some \nbutter and cream. Then your New York City family would be ready to sit down \nand enjoy breakfast, and you could collect your two dimes for your labor!\nSeems absurd, doesn't it? Well, the procedure described would be the only \npossible way these simple items of food could be delivered to the heart of New \nYork City, if we had no capitalistic system.\nThe sum of money required for the building and maintenance of the \nrailroads and steam ships used in the delivery of that simple breakfast is so huge \nthat it staggers one's imagination. It runs into hundreds of millions of dollars, not \nto mention the armies of trained employees required to man the ships and trains. \nBut, transportation is only a part of the requirements of modern civilization in \ncapitalistic America. Before there can be anything to haul, something must be \ngrown from the ground, or manufactured and prepared for market. This calls for \nmore millions of dollars for equipment, machinery, boxing, marketing, and for \nthe wages of millions of men and women.\nSteam ships and railroads do not spring up from the earth and function \nautomatically. They come in response to the call of civilization, through the labor \nand ingenuity and organizing ability of men who have IMAGINATION, FAITH, \nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover  How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n  www.think-and-grow-rich-ebook.com  \n133\n  THINK & GROW RICH   \nENTHUSIASM, DECISION, PERSISTENCE! These men are known as capitalists. \nThey are motivated by the desire to build, construct, achieve, render useful \nservice, earn profits and accumulate riches.

They are the same men to whom radicals, racketeers, dishonest \npoliticians and grafting labor leaders refer as \"the predatory interests,\" or \"Wall \nStreet.\" \nI am not attempting to present a brief for or against any group of men or \nany system of economics.

The line-up was so general and so well organized that it prolonged the \nworst depression America has ever known. It cost millions of men their jobs, \nbecause those jobs were inseparably a part of the industrial and capitalistic \nsystem which form the very backbone of the nation. \nDuring this unusual alliance of government officials and self-seeking \nindividuals who were endeavoring to profit by declaring \"open season\" on the \nAmerican system of industry, a certain type of labor leader joined forces with the \npoliticians and offered to deliver voters in return for legislation designed to \npermit men to TAKE RICHES AWAY FROM INDUSTRY BY ORGANIZED \nFORCE OF NUMBERS, INSTEAD OF THE BETTER METHOD OF GIVING A \nFAIR DAY'S WORK FOR A FAIR DAY'S PAY. \nMillions of men and women throughout the nation are still engaged in \nthis popular pastime of trying to GET without GIVING. Some of them are lined \nup with labor unions, where they demand SHORTER HOURS AND MORE PAY! \nOthers do not take the trouble to work at all. THEY DEMAND GOVERNMENT \nRELIEF AND ARE GETTING IT. Their idea of their rights of freedom was \ndemonstrated in New York City, where violent complaint was registered with \nthe Postmaster, by a group of \"relief beneficiaries,\" because the Postmen \nawakened them at 7: 30 A.

But we know little of the real forces back of these names, dates, and \nplaces. We know still less of that intangible POWER, which insured us freedom \nlong before Washington's armies reached Yorktown. \nWe read the history of the Revolution, and falsely imagine that George \nWashington was the Father of our Country, that it was he who won our freedom, \nwhile the truth is—Washington was only an accessory after the fact, because \nvictory for his armies had been insured long before Lord Cornwallis \nsurrendered. This is not intended to rob Washington of any of the glory he so \nrichly merited.

I say it is a tragedy, because it is the self-same \nPOWER which must be used by every individual who surmounts the difficulties \nof Life, and forces Life to pay the price asked.\nLet us briefly review the events which gave birth to this POWER. The \nstory begins with an incident in Boston, March 5, 1770. British soldiers were \npatroling the streets, by their presence, openly threatening the citizens. The \ncolonists resented armed men marching in their midst. They began to express \ntheir resentment openly, hurling stones as well as epithets, at the marching \nsoldiers, until the commanding officer gave orders, \"Fix bayonets. . . . Charge!\"\nThe battle was on. It resulted in the death and injury of many. The \nincident aroused such resentment that the Provincial Assembly, (made up of \nprominent colonists), called a meeting for the purpose of taking definite action. \nTwo of the members of that Assembly were, John Hancock, and Samuel Adams\n—LONG LIVE THEIR NAMES! They spoke up courageously, and declared that a \nmove must be made to eject all British soldiers from Boston.\nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover  How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n  www.think-and-grow-rich-ebook.com  \n143\n  THINK & GROW RICH   \nRemember this—a DECISION, in the minds of two men, might properly \nbe called the beginning of the freedom which we, of the United States now enjoy. \nRemember, too, that the DECISION of these two men called for FAITH, and \nCOURAGE, because it was dangerous. \nBefore the Assembly adjourned, Samuel Adams was appointed to call on \nthe Governor of the Province, Hutchinson, and demand the withdrawal of the \nBritish troops. \nThe request was granted, the troops were removed from Boston, but the \nincident was not closed. It had caused a situation destined to change the entire \ntrend of civilization. Strange, is it not, how the great changes, such as the \nAmerican Revolution, and the World War, often have their beginnings in \ncircumstances which seem unimportant? It is interesting, also, to observe that \nthese important changes usually begin in the form of a DEFINITE DECISION in \nthe minds of a relatively small number of people. Few of us know the history of \nour country well enough to realize that John Hancock, Samuel Adams, and \nRichard Henry Lee (of the Province of Virginia) were the real Fathers of our \nCountry.\nRichard Henry Lee became an important factor in this story by reason of \nthe fact that he and Samuel Adams communicated frequently (by \ncorrespondence), sharing freely their fears and their hopes concerning the \nwelfare of the people of their Provinces. From this practice, Adams conceived the \nidea that a mutual exchange of letters between the thirteen Colonies might help \nto bring about the coordination of effort so badly needed in connection with the \nsolution of their problems. Two years after the clash with the soldiers in Boston \n(March '72), Adams presented this idea to the Assembly, in the form of a motion \nthat a Correspondence Committee be established among the Colonies, with \ndefinitely appointed correspondents in each Colony, \"for the purpose of friendly \ncooperation for the betterment of the Colonies of British America.\" \nMark well this incident! It was the beginning of the organization of the \nfar-flung POWER destined to give freedom to you, and to me. The Master Mind \nhad already been organized. It consisted of Adams, Lee, and Hancock. \"I tell you \nfurther, that if two of you agree upon the earth concerning anything for which \nyou ask, it will come to you from My Father, who is in Heaven.\" \nThe Committee of Correspondence was organized. Observe that this move \nprovided the way for increasing the power of the Master Mind by adding to it \nmen from all the Colonies. Take notice that this procedure constituted the first \nORGANIZED PLANNING of the disgruntled Colonists.\nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover  How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n  www.think-and-grow-rich-ebook.com  \n144\n  THINK & GROW RICH   \nIn union there is strength! The citizens of the Colonies had been waging \ndisorganized warfare against the British soldiers, through incidents similar to the \nBoston riot, but nothing of benefit had been accomplished. Their individual \ngrievances had not been consolidated under one Master Mind. No group of \nindividuals had put their hearts, minds, souls, and bodies together in one \ndefinite DECISION to settle their difficulty with the British once and for all, until \nAdams, Hancock, and Lee got together. \nMeanwhile, the British were not idle. They, too, were doing some \nPLANNING and \"Master-Minding\" on their own account, with the advantage of \nhaving back of them money, and organized soldiery. \nThe Crown appointed Gage to supplant Hutchinson as the Governor of \nMassachusetts. One of the new Governor's first acts was to send a messenger to \ncall on Samuel Adams, for the purpose of endeavoring to stop his opposition— \nby FEAR. \nWe can best understand the spirit of what happened by quoting the \nconversation between Col. Fenton, (the messenger sent by Gage), and Adams. \nCol. Fenton: \"I have been authorized by Governor Gage, to assure you, \nMr. Adams, that the Governor has been empowered to confer upon you such \nbenefits as would be satisfactory, [endeavor to win Adams by promise of bribes], \nupon the condition that you engage to cease in your opposition to the measures \nof the government.

He could cease his \nopposition, and receive personal bribes, or he could CONTINUE, AND RUN \nTHE RISK OF BEING HANGED!\nClearly, the time had come when Adams was forced to reach instantly, a \nDECISION which could have cost his life. The majority of men would have \nfound it difficult to reach such a decision. The majority would have sent back an \nevasive reply, but not Adams! He insisted upon Col. Fenton's word of honor, that \nthe Colonel would deliver to the Governor the answer exactly as Adams would \ngive it to him. \nAdams' answer, \"Then you may tell Governor Gage that I trust I have long \nsince made my peace with the King of Kings.

And, TELL \nGOVERNOR GAGE IT IS THE ADVICE OF SAMUEL ADAMS TO HIM, no \nlonger to insult the feelings of an exasperated people.\"\nComment as to the character of this man seems unnecessary. It must be \nobvious to all who read this astounding message that its sender possessed \nloyalty of the highest order. This is important. (Racketeers and dishonest \npoliticians have prostituted the honor for which such men as Adams died).\nWhen Governor Gage received Adams' caustic reply, he flew into a rage, \nand issued a proclamation which read, \"I do, hereby, in his majesty's name, offer \nand promise his most gracious pardon to all persons who shall forthwith lay \ndown their arms, and return to the duties of peaceable subjects, excepting only \nfrom the benefit of such pardon, SAMUEL ADAMS AND JOHN HANCOCK, \nwhose offences are of too flagitious a nature to admit of any other consideration \nbut that of condign punishment.\" \nAs one might say, in modern slang, Adams and Hancock were \"on the \nspot!\" The threat of the irate Governor forced the two men to reach another \nDECISION, equally as dangerous. They hurriedly called a secret meeting of their \nstaunchest followers. (Here the Master Mind began to take on momentum). After \nthe meeting had been called to order, Adams locked the door, placed the key in \nhis pocket, and informed all present that it was imperative that a Congress of the \nColonists be organized, and that NO MAN SHOULD LEAVE THE ROOM \nUNTIL THE DECISION FOR SUCH A CONGRESS HAD BEEN REACHED. \nGreat excitement followed. Some weighed the possible consequences of \nsuch radicalism. (Old Man Fear). Some expressed grave doubt as to the wisdom \nof so definite a decision in defiance of the Crown. Locked in that room were TWO \nMEN immune to Fear, blind to the possibility of Failure.

It is more important than July 4, 1776.

Inspired by the threat, one of Jefferson's colleagues, Patrick Henry, \nboldly spoke his mind, concluding his remarks with a sentence which shall \nremain forever a classic, \"If this be treason, then make the most of it.\"\nIt was such men as these who, without power, without authority, without \nmilitary strength, without money, sat in solemn consideration of the destiny of \nthe colonies, beginning at the opening of the First Continental Congress, and \ncontinuing at intervals for two years— until on June 7, 1776, Richard Henry Lee \narose, addressed the Chair, and to the startled Assembly made this motion: \n\"Gentlemen, I make the motion that these United Colonies are, and of \nright ought to be free and independent states, that they be absolved from all \nallegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them \nand the state of Great Britain is, and ought to be totally dissolved.\" \nLee's astounding motion was discussed fervently, and at such length that \nhe began to lose patience. Finally, after days of argument, he again took the floor, \nand declared, in a clear, firm voice, \"Mr. President, we have discussed this issue \nfor days. It is the only course for us to follow. Why, then Sir, do we longer delay? \nWhy still deliberate? Let this happy day give birth to an American Republic. Let \nher arise, not to devastate and to conquer, but to re-establish the reign of peace, \nand of law. The eyes of Europe are fixed upon us. She demands of us a living \nexample of freedom, that may exhibit a contrast, in the felicity of the citizen, to \nthe ever increasing tyranny.\" \nBefore his motion was finally voted upon, Lee was called back to Virginia, \nbecause of serious family illness, but before leaving, he placed his cause in the \nhands of his friend, Thomas Jefferson, who promised to fight until favorable \naction was taken. Shortly thereafter the President of the Congress (Hancock), \nappointed Jefferson as Chairman of a Committee to draw up a Declaration of \nIndependence. \nLong and hard the Committee labored, on a document which would \nmean, when accepted by the Congress, that EVERY MAN WHO SIGNED IT, \nWOULD BE SIGNING HIS OWN DEATH WARRANT, should the Colonies lose \nin the fight with Great Britain, which was sure to follow. \nThe document was drawn, and on June 28, the original draft was read \nbefore the Congress. For several days it was discussed, altered, and made ready. \nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover  How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n  www.think-and-grow-rich-ebook.com  \n147\n  THINK & GROW RICH   \nOn July 4, 1776, Thomas Jefferson stood before the Assembly, and fearlessly read \nthe most momentus DECISION ever placed upon paper. \n\"When in the course of human events it is necessary for one people to \ndissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to \nassume, among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which \nthe laws of Nature, and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the \nopinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel \nthem to the separation. . . \"\nWhen Jefferson finished, the document was voted upon, accepted, and \nsigned by the fifty-six men, every one staking his own life upon his DECISION to \nwrite his name. By that DECISION came into existence a nation destined to bring \nto mankind forever, the privilege of making DECISIONS.\nBy decisions made in a similar spirit of Faith, and only by such decisions, \ncan men solve their personal problems, and win for themselves high estates of \nmaterial and spiritual wealth. Let us not forget this! \nAnalyze the events which led to the Declaration of Independence, and be \nconvinced that this nation, which now holds a position of commanding respect \nand power among all nations of the world, was born of a DECISION created by a \nMaster Mind, consisting of fifty-six men. Note well, the fact that it was their \nDECISION which insured the success of Washington's armies, because the spirit \nof that decision was in the heart of every soldier who fought with him, and \nserved as a spiritual power which recognizes no such thing as FAILURE.\nNote, also, (with great personal benefit), that the POWER which gave this \nnation its freedom, is the self-same power that must be used by every individual \nwho becomes self-determining. This POWER is made up of the principles \ndescribed in this book. It will not be difficult to detect, in the story of the \nDeclaration of Independence, at least six of these principles; DESIRE, DECISION, \nFAITH, PERSISTENCE, THE MASTER MIND, and ORGANIZED PLANNING.\nThroughout this philosophy will be found the suggestion that thought, \nbacked by strong DESIRE, has a tendency to transmute itself into its physical \nequivalent. Before passing on, I wish to leave with you the suggestion that one \nmay find in this story, and in the story of the organization of the United States \nSteel Corporation, a perfect description of the method by which thought makes \nthis astounding transformation. \nIn your search for the secret of the method, do not loo for a miracle, \nbecause you will not find it.

They may be used to bring freedom to a nation, or to accumulate riches. \nThere is no charge save the time necessary to understand and appropriate them.\nThose who reach DECISIONS promptly and definitely, know what they \nwant, and generally get it. The leaders in every walk of life DECIDE quickly, and \nfirmly. That is the major reason why they are leaders. The world has the habit of \nmaking room for the man whose words and actions show that he knows where \nhe is going.\nINDECISION is a habit which usually begins in youth. The habit takes on \npermanency as the youth goes through graded school, high school, and even \nthrough college, without DEFINITENESS OF PURPOSE. The major weakness of \nall educational systems is that they neither teach nor encourage the habit of \nDEFINITE DECISION.\nIt would be beneficial if no college would permit the enrollment of any \nstudent, unless and until the student declared his major purpose in \nmatriculating. It would be of still greater benefit, if every student who enters the \ngraded schools were compelled to accept training in the HABIT OF DECISION, \nand forced to pass a satisfactory examination on this subject before being \npermitted to advance in the grades.\nThe habit of INDECISION acquired because of the deficiencies of our \nschool systems, goes with the student into the occupation he chooses . . . IF . . in \nfact, he chooses his occupation. Generally, the youth just out of school seeks any \njob that can be found. He takes the first place he finds, because he has fallen into \nthe habit of INDECISION. Ninety-eight out of every hundred people working for \nwages today, are in the positions they hold, because they lacked the \nDEFINITENESS OF DECISION to PLAN A DEFINITE POSITION, and the \nknowledge of how to choose an employer.\nDEFINITENESS OF DECISION always requires courage, sometimes very \ngreat courage. The fifty-six men who signed the Declaration of Independence \nstaked their lives on the DECISION to affix their signatures to that document. \nThe person who reaches a DEFINITE DECISION to procure the particular job, \nand make life pay the price he asks, does not stake his life on that decision; he \nstakes his ECONOMIC FREEDOM. Financial independence, riches, desirable \nbusiness and professional positions are not within reach of the person who \nneglects or refuses to EXPECT, PLAN, and DEMAND these things. The person \nwho desires riches in the same spirit that Samuel Adams desired freedom for the \nColonies, is sure to accumulate wealth.\nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover  How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n  www.think-and-grow-rich-ebook.com  \n149\n  THINK & GROW RICH   \nIn the chapter on Organized Planning, you will find complete instructions \nfor marketing every type of personal services.

The basis of persistence is the POWER OF \nWILL.\nWill-power and desire, when properly combined, make an irresistible \npair. Men who accumulate great fortunes are generally known as cold-blooded, \nand sometimes ruthless. Often they are misunderstood. What they have is will-\npower, which they mix with persistence, and place back of their desires to insure \nthe attainment of their objectives.\nHenry Ford has been generally misunderstood to be ruthless and cold-\nblooded. This misconception grew out of Ford's habit of following through in all \nof his plans with PERSISTENCE. \nThe majority of people are ready to throw their aims and purposes \noverboard, and give up at the first sign of opposition or misfortune. A few carry \non DESPITE all opposition, until they attain their goal. These few are the Fords, \nCarnegies, Rockefellers, and Edisons. \nThere may be no heroic connotation to the word \"persistence,\" but the \nquality is to the character of man what carbon is to steel.\nThe building of a fortune, generally, involves the application of the entire \nthirteen factors of this philosophy. These principles must be understood, they \nmust be applied with PERSISTENCE by all who accumulate money. \nIf you are following this book with the intention of applying the \nknowledge it conveys, your first test as to your PERSISTENCE will come when \nyou begin to follow the six steps described in the second chapter. Unless you are \none of the two out of every hundred who already have a DEFINITE GOAL at \nwhich you are aiming, and a DEFINITE PLAN for its attainment, you may read \nthe instructions, and then pass on with your daily routine, and never comply \nwith those instructions.\nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover  How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n  www.think-and-grow-rich-ebook.com  \n151\n  THINK & GROW RICH   \nThe author is checking you up at this point, because lack of persistence is \none of the major causes of failure. Moreover, experience with thousands of \npeople has proved that lack of persistence is a weakness common to the majority \nof men. It is a weakness which may be overcome by effort. The ease with which \nlack of persistence may be conquered will depend entirely upon the INTENSITY \nOF ONE'S DESIRE.\nThe starting point of all achievement is DESIRE. Keep this constantly in \nmind. Weak desires bring weak results, just as a small amount of fire makes a \nsmall amount of heat. If you find yourself lacking in persistence, this weakness \nmay be remedied by building a stronger fire under your desires. \nContinue to read through to the end, then go back to Chapter two, and \nstart immediately to carry out the instructions given in connection with the six \nsteps. The eagerness with which you follow these instructions will indicate \nclearly, how much, or how little you really DESIRE to accumulate money. If you \nfind that you are indifferent, you may be sure that you have not yet acquired the \n\"money consciousness\" which you must possess, before you can be sure of \naccumulating a fortune. \nFortunes gravitate to men whose minds have been prepared to \"attract\" \nthem, just as surely as water gravitates to the ocean. In this book may be found \nall the stimuli necessary to \"attune\" any normal mind to the vibrations which will \nattract the object of one's desires.\nIf you find you are weak in PERSISTENCE, center your attention upon the \ninstructions contained in the chapter on \"Power\"; surround yourself with a \n\"MASTER MIND\" group, and through the cooperative efforts of the members of \nthis group, you can develop persistence. You will find additional instructions for \nthe development of persistence in the chapters on auto-suggestion, and the \nsubconscious mind. Follow the instructions outlined in these chapters until your \nhabit nature hands over to your subconscious mind, a clear picture of the object \nof your DESIRE. From that point on, you will not be handicapped by lack of \npersistence. \nYour subconscious mind works continuously, while you are awake, and \nwhile you are asleep. \nSpasmodic, or occasional effort to apply the rules will be of no value to \nyou. To get RESULTS, you must apply all of the rules until their application \nbecomes a fixed habit with you.

You are lying in bed, half awake, with a feeling that you are about to \nsmother. You are unable to turn over, or to move a muscle. You realize that you \nMUST BEGIN to regain control over your muscles. Through persistent effort of \nwill-power, you finally manage to move the fingers of one hand. By continuing \nto move your fingers, you extend your control to the muscles of one arm, until \nyou can lift it. Then you gain control of the other arm in the same manner. You \nfinally gain control over the muscles of one leg, and then extend it to the other \nleg. THEN— WITH ONE SUPREME EFFORT OF WILL— you regain complete \ncontrol over your muscular system, and \"snap\" out of your nightmare. The trick \nhas been turned step by step. \nYou may find it necessary to \"snap\" out of your mental inertia, through a \nsimilar procedure, moving slowly at first, then increasing your speed, until you \ngain complete control over your will. Be PERSISTENT no matter how slowly you \nmay, at first, have to move. WITH PERSISTENCE WILL COME SUCCESS. \nIf you select your \"Master Mind\" group with care, you will have in it, at \nleast one person who will aid you in the development of PERSISTENCE. Some \nmen who have accumulated great fortunes, did so because of NECESSITY. They \ndeveloped the habit of PERSISTENCE, because they were so closely driven by \ncircumstances, that they had to become persistent. \nTHERE IS NO SUBSTITUTE FOR PERSISTENCE! It cannot be supplanted \nby any other quality! Remember this, and it will hearten you, in the beginning, \nwhen the going may seem difficult and slow.\nThose who have cultivated the HABIT of persistence seem to enjoy \ninsurance against failure.

Those who pick themselves up after defeat and keep on trying, \narrive; and the world cries, \"Bravo! I knew you could do it!\" The hidden Guide \nlets no one enjoy great achievement without passing the PERSISTENCE TEST. \nThose who can't take it, simply do not make the grade. \nThose who can \"take it\" are bountifully rewarded for their PERSISTENCE. \nThey receive, as their compensation, whatever goal they are pursuing. That is not \nall! They receive something infinitely more important than material \ncompensation— the knowledge that \"EVERY FAILURE BRINGS WITH IT THE \nSEED OF AN EQUIVALENT ADVANTAGE.\" \nThere are exceptions to this rule; a few people know from experience the \nsoundness of persistence. They are the ones who have not accepted defeat as \nbeing anything more than temporary. They are the ones whose DESIRES are so \nPERSISTENTLY APPLIED that defeat is finally changed into victory. We who \nstand on the side-lines of Life see the overwhelmingly large number who go \ndown in defeat, never to rise again. We see the few who take the punishment of \ndefeat as an urge to greater effort. These, fortunately, never learn to accept Life's \nreverse gear. But what we DO NOT SEE, what most of us never suspect of \nexisting, is the silent but irresistible POWER which comes to the rescue of those \nwho fight on in the face of discouragement. If we speak of this power at all we \ncall it PERSISTENCE, and let it go at that. One thing we all know, if one does not \npossess PERSISTENCE, one does not achieve noteworthy success in any calling. \nAs these lines are being written, I look up from my work, and see before \nme, less than a block away, the great mysterious \"Broadway,\" the \"Graveyard of \nDead Hopes,\" and the \"Front Porch of Opportunity.\" From all over the world \npeople have come to Broadway, seeking fame, fortune, power, love, or whatever \nit is that human beings call success. Once in a great while someone steps out \nfrom the long procession of seekers, and the world hears that another person has \nmastered Broadway. But Broadway is not easily nor quickly conquered. She \nacknowledges talent, recognizes genius, pays off in money, only after one has \nrefused to QUIT.\nThen we know he has discovered the secret of how to conquer Broadway. \nThe secret is always inseparably attached to one word, PERSISTENCE! \nThe secret is told in the struggle of Fannie Hurst, whose PERSISTENCE \nconquered the Great White Way.

She spent her days laboring, and her nights HOPING. When \nhope grew dim, she did not say, \"Alright Broadway, you win!\" She said, \"Very \nwell, Broadway, you may whip some, but not me. I'm going to force you to give \nup.\" \nOne publisher (The Saturday Evening Post) sent her thirty six rejection \nslips, before she \"broke the ice and got a story across. The average writer, like the \n\"average\" in other walks of life, would have given up the job when the first \nrejection slip came. She pounded the pavements for four years to the tune of the \npublisher's \"NO,\" because she was determined to win.\nThen came the \"payoff.\" The spell had been broken, the unseen Guide had \ntested Fannie Hurst, and she could take it. From that time on publishers made a \nbeaten path to her door. Money came so fast she hardly had time to count it. \nThen the moving picture men discovered her, and money came not in small \nchange, but in floods. The moving picture rights to her latest novel, \"Great \nLaughter,\" brought $100,000.00, said to be the highest price ever paid for a story \nbefore publication. Her royalties from the sale of the book probably will run \nmuch more.\nBriefly, you have a description of what PERSISTENCE is capable of \nachieving. Fannie Hurst is no exception. Wherever men and women accumulate \ngreat riches, you may be sure they first acquired PERSISTENCE. Broadway will \ngive any beggar a cup of coffee and a sandwich, but it demands PERSISTENCE \nof those who go after the big stakes.\nKate Smith will say \"amen\" when she reads this. For years she sang, \nwithout money, and without price, before any microphone she could reach. \nBroadway said to her, \"Come and get it, if you can take it.\" She did take it until \none happy day Broadway got tired and said, \"Aw, what's the use? You don't \nknow when you're whipped, so name your price, and go to work in earnest.\" \nMiss Smith named her price! It was plenty. Away up in figures so high that one \nweek's salary is far more than most people make in a whole year. \nVerily it pays to be PERSISTENT!\nAnd here is an encouraging statement which carries with it a suggestion \nof great significance— THOUSANDS OF SINGERS WHO EXCEL KATE SMITH \nARE WALKING UP AND DOWN BROADWAY LOOKING FOR A \"BREAK\"— \nWITHOUT SUCCESS. Countless others have come and gone, many of them sang \nwell enough, but they failed to make the grade because they lacked the courage \nto keep on keeping on, until Broadway became tired of turning them away. \nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover  How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n  www.think-and-grow-rich-ebook.com  \n155\n  THINK & GROW RICH   \nPersistence is a state of mind, therefore it can be cultivated. Like all states of \nmind, persistence is based upon definite causes, among them these:—\na. DEFINITENESS OF PURPOSE. Knowing what one wants \nis the first and, perhaps, the most important step toward the \ndevelopment of persistence. A strong motive forces one to \nsurmount many difficulties. \nb. DESIRE. It is comparatively easy to acquire and to \nmaintain persistence in pursuing the object of intense desire. \nc. SELF-RELIANCE. Belief in one's ability to carry out a plan \nencourages one to follow the plan through with persistence. (Self-\nreliance can be developed through the principle described in the \nchapter on auto-suggestion). \nd. DEFINITENESS OF PLANS. Organized plans, even \nthough they may be weak and entirely impractical, encourage \npersistence.\ne. ACCURATE KNOWLEDGE. Knowing that one's plans are \nsound, based upon experience or observation, encourages \npersistence; \"guessing\" instead of \"knowing\" destroys persistence.\nf. CO-OPERATION. Sympathy, understanding, and \nharmonious cooperation with others tend to develop persistence. \ng. WILL-POWER.

Searching for all the shortcuts to riches, trying to GET \nwithout GIVING a fair equivalent, usually reflected in the habit of \ngambling, endeavoring to drive \"sharp\" bargains. \n16. FEAR OF CRITICISM, failure to create plans and to put \nthem into action, because of what other people will think, do, or \nsay. This enemy belongs at the head of the list, because it generally \nexists in one's subconscious mind, where its presence is not \nrecognized.

The \nmajority of people permit relatives, friends, and the public at large to so \ninfluence them that they cannot live their own lives, because they fear criticism. \nHuge numbers of people make mistakes in marriage, stand by the bargain, \nand go through life miserable and unhappy, because they fear criticism which \nmay follow if they correct the mistake. (Anyone who has submitted to this form \nof fear knows the irreparable damage it does, by destroying ambition, self-\nreliance, and the desire to achieve).\nMillions of people neglect to acquire belated educations, after having left \nschool, because they fear criticism. \nCountless numbers of men and women, both young and old, permit \nrelatives to wreck their lives in the name of DUTY, because they fear criticism. \n(Duty does not require any person to submit to the destruction of his personal \nambitions and the right to live his own life in his own way). \nPeople refuse to take chances in business, because they fear the criticism \nwhich may follow if they fail. The fear of criticism, in such cases is stronger than the \nDESIRE for success. \nToo many people refuse to set high goals for themselves, or even neglect \nselecting a career, because they fear the criticism of relatives and \"friends\" who \nmay say \"Don't aim so high, people will think you are crazy. \nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover  How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n  www.think-and-grow-rich-ebook.com  \n158\n  THINK & GROW RICH   \nWhen Andrew Carnegie suggested that I devote twenty years to the \norganization of a philosophy of individual achievement my first impulse of \nthought was fear of what people might say.

Something inside of me said, \"You can't do it— the job is too big, \nand requires too much time— what will your relatives think of you ?— how will \nyou earn a living?— no one has ever organized a philosophy of success, what \nright have you to believe you can do it?— who are you, anyway, to aim so high?\n— remember your humble birth— what do you know about philosophy— \npeople will think you are crazy—( and they did)— why hasn't some other person \ndone this before now?\" \nThese, and many other questions flashed into my mind, and demanded \nattention.

It \nis the privilege of writing one's own ticket, and of making Life yield whatever \nprice is asked.\nI have no way of knowing the facts, but I venture to conjecture that Mrs. \nWallis Simpson's great love for a man was not accidental, nor the result of \nfavorable \"breaks\" alone. There was a burning desire, and careful searching at \nevery step of the way. Her first duty was to love. What is the greatest thing on \nearth? The Master called it love—not man made rules, criticism, bitterness, \nslander, or political \"marriages,\" but love. \nShe knew what she wanted, not after she met the Prince of Wales, but long \nbefore that. Twice when she had failed to find it, she had the courage to continue \nher search. \"To thine own self be true, and it must follow, as the night the day, \nthou canst not then be false to any man.\" \nHer rise from obscurity was of the slow, progressive, PERSISTENT order, \nbut it was SURE!

Did he pay too high a price for the \naffections of the woman of his choice?\nSurely no one but he can give the correct answer. The rest of us can only \nconjecture. This much we know, the king came into the world without his own \nconsent. He was born to great riches, without requesting them. He was \npersistently sought in marriage; politicians and statesmen throughout Europe \ntossed dowagers and princesses at his feet. Because he was the first born of his \nparents, he inherited a crown, which he did not seek, and perhaps did not desire. \nFor more than forty years he was not a free agent, could not live his life in his \nown way, had but little privacy, and finally assumed duties inflicted upon him \nwhen he ascended the throne.\nSome will say, \"With all these blessings, King Edward should have found \npeace of mind, contentment, and joy of living.\" \nThe truth is that back of all the privileges of a crown, all the money, the \nfame, and the power inherited by King Edward, there was an emptiness which \ncould be filled only by love. \nHis greatest DESIRE was for love. Long before he met Wallis Simpson, he \ndoubtless felt this great universal emotion tugging at the strings of his heart, \nbeating upon the door of his soul, and crying out for expression.\nAnd when he met a kindred spirit, crying out for this same Holy privilege \nof expression, he recognized it, and without fear or apology, opened his heart \nand bade it enter. All the scandal-mongers in the world cannot destroy the \nbeauty of this international drama, through which two people found love, and \nhad the courage to face open criticism, renounce ALL ELSE to give it holy \nexpression. \nKing Edward's DECISION to give up the crown of the world's most \npowerful empire, for the privilege of going the remainder of the way through life \nwith the woman of his choice, was a decision that required courage. The decision \nalso had a price, but who has the right to say the price was too great? Surely not \nHe who said, \"He among you who is without sin, let him cast the first stone.\" \nAs a suggestion to any evil-minded person who chooses to find fault with \nthe Duke of Windsor, because his DESIRE was for LOVE, and for openly \ndeclaring his love for Wallis Simpson, and giving up his throne for her, let it be \nremembered that the OPEN DECLARATION was not essential.

A story in \nwhich Love and not Hate would rule. \nIn the words of Stuart Austin Wier we raise our cup and drink this toast to \nex-king Edward and Wallis Simpson: \n\"Blessed is the man who has come to know that our muted thoughts are \nour sweetest thoughts. \n\"Blessed is the man who, from the blackest depths, can see the luminous \nfigure of LOVE, and seeing, sing; and singing, say: 'Sweeter far than uttered lays \nare the thoughts I have of you.

He was \nnot a mystic; he had no formal schooling; he did not begin his mission until he \nwas forty. When he announced that he was the Messenger of God, bringing word \nof the true religion, he was ridiculed and labeled a lunatic. Children tripped him \nand women threw filth upon him. He was banished from his native city, Mecca, \nand his followers were stripped of their worldly goods and sent into the desert \nafter him. When he had been preaching ten years he had nothing to show for it \nbut banishment, poverty and ridicule. Yet before another ten years had passed, \nhe was dictator of all Arabia, ruler of Mecca, and the head of a New World \nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover  How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n  www.think-and-grow-rich-ebook.com  \n164\n  THINK & GROW RICH   \nreligion which was to sweep to the Danube and the Pyrenees before exhausting \nthe impetus he gave it. That impetus was three-fold: the power of words, the \nefficacy of prayer and man's kinship with God. \n\"His career never made sense. Mohammed was born to impoverished \nmembers of a leading family of Mecca. Because Mecca, the crossroads of the \nworld, home of the magic stone called the Caaba, great city of trade and the \ncenter of trade routes, was unsanitary, its children were sent to be raised in the \ndesert by Bedouins. Mohammed was thus nurtured, drawing strength and health \nfrom the milk of nomad, vicarious mothers. He tended sheep and soon hired out \nto a rich widow as leader of her caravans. He traveled to all parts of the Eastern \nWorld, talked with many men of diverse beliefs and observed the decline of \nChristianity into warring sects. When he was twenty-eight, Khadija, the widow, \nlooked upon him with favor, and married him. Her father would have objected \nto such a marriage, so she got him drunk and held him up while he gave the \npaternal blessing. For the next twelve years Mohammed lived as a rich and \nrespected and very shrewd trader. Then he took to wandering in the desert, and \none day he returned with the first verse of the Koran and told Khadija that the \narchangel Gabriel had appeared to him and said that he was to be the Messenger \nof God.\n\"The Koran, the revealed word of God, was the closest thing to a miracle \nin Mohammed's life. He had not been a poet; he had no gift of words. Yet the \nverses of the Koran, as he received them and recited them to the faithful, were \nbetter than any verses which the professional poets of the tribes could produce. \nThis, to the Arabs, was a miracle. To them the gift of words was the greatest gift, \nthe poet was all-powerful. In addition the Koran said that all men were equal \nbefore God, that the world should be a democratic state— Islam. It was this \npolitical heresy, plus Mohammed's desire to destroy all the 360 idols in the \ncourtyard of the Caaba, which brought about his banishment. The idols brought \nthe desert tribes to Mecca, and that meant trade. So the business men of Mecca, \nthe capitalists, of which he had been one, set upon Mohammed. Then he \nretreated to the desert and demanded sovereignty over the world. \n\"The rise of Islam began. Out of the desert came a flame which would not \nbe extinguished— a democratic army fighting as a unit and prepared to die \nwithout wincing. Mohammed had invited the Jews and Christians to join him; \nfor he was not building a new religion. He was calling all who believed in one \nGod to join in a single faith. If the Jews and Christians had accepted his invitation \nIslam would have conquered the world. They didn't.

This chapter will describe the method by which an individual may \nattain and apply POWER. \nPOWER may be defined as \"organized and intelligently directed \nKNOWLEDGE.\" Power, as the term is here used, refers to ORGANIZED effort, \nsufficient to enable an individual to transmute DESIRE into its monetary \nequivalent. ORGANIZED effort is produced through the coordination of effort of \ntwo or more people, who work toward a DEFINITE end, in a spirit of harmony. \nPOWER IS REQUIRED FOR THE ACCUMULATION OF MONEY! \nPOWER IS NECESSARY FOR THE RETENTION OF MONEY AFTER IT HAS \nBEEN ACCUMULATED!\nLet us ascertain how power may be acquired.

It may be \nconverted into POWER by organizing it into definite PLANS and by expressing \nthose plans in terms of ACTION. \nExamination of the three major sources of knowledge will readily disclose \nthe difficulty an individual would have, if he depended upon his efforts alone, in \nassembling knowledge and expressing it through definite plans in terms of \nACTION. If his plans are comprehensive, and if they contemplate large \nproportions, he must, generally, induce others to cooperate with him, before he \ncan inject into them the necessary element of POWER. \nGAINING POWER THROUGH THE '' MASTER MIND\"\nThe \"Master Mind\" may be defined as: \"Coordination of knowledge and \neffort, in a spirit of harmony, between two or more people, for the attainment of \na definite purpose.\" \nNo individual may have great power without availing himself of the \n\"Master Mind.\" In a preceding chapter, instructions were given for the creation of \nPLANS for the purpose of translating DESIRE into its monetary equivalent. If \nyou carry out these instructions with PERSISTENCE and intelligence, and use \ndiscrimination in the selection of your \"Master Mind\" group, your objective will \nhave been half-way reached, even before you begin to recognize it. \nSo you may better understand the \"intangible\" potentialities of power \navailable to you, through a properly chosen \"Master Mind\" group, we will here \nexplain the two characteristics of the Master Mind principle, one of which is \neconomic in nature, and the other psychic. The economic feature is obvious. \nEconomic advantages may be created by any person who surrounds himself with \nthe advice, counsel, and personal cooperation of a group of men who are willing \nto lend him wholehearted aid, in a spirit of PERFECT HARMONY. This form of \ncooperative alliance has been the basis of nearly every great fortune. Your \nunderstanding of this great truth may definitely determine your financial status. \nThe psychic phase of the Master Mind principle is much more abstract, \nmuch more difficult to comprehend, because it has reference to the spiritual \nforces with which the human race, as a whole, is not well acquainted.

It is a well known fact that matter may be \nbroken down into units of molecules, atoms, and electrons. There are units of \nmatter which may be isolated, separated, and analyzed. \nLikewise, there are units of energy. \nThe human mind is a form of energy, a part of it being spiritual in nature. \nWhen the minds of two people are coordinated in a SPIRIT OF HARMONY, the \nspiritual units of energy of each mind form an affinity, which constitutes the \n\"psychic\" phase of the Master Mind. \nThe Master Mind principle, or rather the economic feature of it, was first \ncalled to my attention by Andrew Carnegie, over twenty-five years ago. \nDiscovery of this principle was responsible for the choice of my life's work. \nMr. Carnegie's Master Mind group consisted of a staff of approximately \nfifty men, with whom he surrounded himself, for the DEFINITE PURPOSE of \nmanufacturing and marketing steel. He attributed his entire fortune to the \nPOWER he accumulated through this \"Master Mind.\" \nAnalyze the record of any man who has accumulated a great fortune, and \nmany of those who have accumulated modest fortunes, and you will find that \nthey have either consciously, or unconsciously employed the \"Master Mind\" \nprinciple. \nGREAT POWER CAN BE ACCUMULATED THROUGH NO OTHER \nPRINCIPLE!\nENERGY is Nature's universal set of building blocks, out of which she \nconstructs every material thing in the universe, including man, and every form of \nanimal and vegetable life. Through a process which only Nature completely \nunderstands, she translates energy into matter. \nNature's building blocks are available to man, in the energy involved in \nTHINKING! Man's brain may be compared to an electric battery. It absorbs \nenergy from the ether, which permeates every atom of matter, and fills the entire \nuniverse.\nIt is a well known fact that a group of electric batteries will provide more \nenergy than a single battery. It is also a well known fact that an individual \nbattery will provide energy in proportion to the number and capacity of the cells \nit contains. \nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover  How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n  www.think-and-grow-rich-ebook.com  \n169\n  THINK & GROW RICH   \nThe brain functions in a similar fashion.

It is an equally well known \nfact that, within the inconceivably short period of ten years, Mr. Ford mastered \nthese three handicaps, and that within twenty-five years he made himself one of \nthe richest men in America. Connect with this fact, the additional knowledge that \nMr. Ford's most rapid strides became noticeable, from the time he became a \npersonal friend of Thomas A. Edison, and you will begin to understand what the \ninfluence of one mind upon another can accomplish. Go a step farther, and \nconsider the fact that Mr. Ford's most outstanding achievements began from the \ntime that he formed the acquaintances of Harvey Firestone, John Burroughs, and \nLuther Burbank, (each a man of great brain capacity), and you will have further \nevidence that POWER may be produced through friendly alliance of minds. \nThere is little if any doubt that Henry Ford is one of the best informed \nmen in the business and industrial world. The question of his wealth needs no \ndiscussion. Analyze Mr. Ford's intimate personal friends, some of whom have \nalready been mentioned, and you will be prepared to understand the following \nstatement:— \"Men take on the nature and the habits and the POWER OF \nTHOUGHT of those with whom they associate in a spirit of sympathy and \nharmony.\" \nHenry Ford whipped poverty, illiteracy, and ignorance by allying himself \nwith great minds, whose vibrations of thought he absorbed into his own mind. \nThrough his association with Edison, Burbank, Burroughs, and Firestone, Mr. \nFord added to his own brain power, the sum and substance of the intelligence, \nexperience, knowledge, and spiritual forces of these four men.

Perhaps the majority of \nthose who have heard of Gandhi, look upon him as merely an eccentric little \nman, who goes around without formal wearing apparel, and makes trouble for \nthe British Government. In reality, Gandhi is not eccentric, but HE IS THE MOST \nPOWERFUL MAN NOW LIVING. (Estimated by the number of his followers \nand their faith in their leader.) Moreover, he is probably the most powerful man \nwho has ever lived.His power is passive, but it is real.\nLet us study the method by which he attained his stupendous POWER. It \nmay be explained in a few words. He came by POWER through inducing over \ntwo hundred million people to coordinate, with mind and body, in a spirit of \nHARMONY, for a DEFINITE PURPOSE.\nIn brief, Gandhi has accomplished a MIRACLE, for it is a miracle when \ntwo hundred million people can be induced— not forced— to cooperate in a \nspirit of HARMONY, for a limitless time. If you doubt that this is a miracle, try to \ninduce ANY TWO PEOPLE to cooperate in a spirit of harmony for any length of \ntime. \nEvery man who manages a business knows what a difficult matter it is to \nget employees to work together in a spirit even remotely resembling \nHARMONY. \nThe list of the chief sources from which POWER may be attained is, as you \nhave seen, headed by INFINITE INTELLIGENCE. When two or more people \ncoordinate in a spirit of HARMONY, and work toward a definite objective, they \nplace themselves in position, through that alliance, to absorb power directly from \nthe great universal storehouse of Infinite Intelligence. This is the greatest of all \nsources of POWER. It is the source to which the genius turns. It is the source to \nwhich every great leader turns, (whether he may be conscious of the fact or not).\nThe other two major sources from which the knowledge, necessary for the \naccumulation of POWER, may be obtained are no more reliable than the five \nsenses of man. The senses are not always reliable. Infinite Intelligence DOES \nNOT ERR. \nIn subsequent chapters, the methods by which Infinite Intelligence may be \nmost readily contacted will be adequately described. \nThis is not a course on religion.

Soon, the entire subject will \nunfold, and you will see it in perspective. You are now seeing the detail of the \nindividual chapters.\nMoney is as shy and elusive as the \"old time\" maiden. It must be wooed \nand won by methods not unlike those used by a determined lover, in pursuit of \nthe girl of his choice. And, coincidental as it is, the POWER used in the \"wooing\" \nof money is not greatly different from that used in wooing a maiden. That power, \nwhen successfully used in the pursuit of money must be mixed with FAITH. It \nmust be mixed with DESIRE. It must be mixed with PERSISTENCE. It must be \napplied through a plan, and that plan must be set into ACTION. \nWhen money comes in quantities known as \"the big money,\" it flows to \nthe one who accumulates it, as easily as water flows down hill. There exists a \ngreat unseen stream of POWER, which may be compared to a river; except that \none side flows in one direction, carrying all who get into that side of the stream, \nonward and upward to WEALTH— and the other side flows in the opposite \ndirection, carrying all who are unfortunate enough to get into it (and not able to \nextricate themselves from it), downward to misery and POVERTY.\nEvery man who has accumulated a great fortune, has recognized the \nexistence of this stream of life. It consists of one's THINKING PROCESS. The \npositive emotions of thought form the side of the stream which carries one to \nfortune. The negative emotions form the side which carries one down to poverty. \nThis carries a thought of stupendous importance to the person who is \nfollowing this book with the object of accumulating a fortune. \nIf you are in the side of the stream of POWER which leads to poverty, this \nmay serve as an oar, by which you may propel yourself over into the other side \nof the stream. It can serve you ONLY through application and use. Merely \nreading, and passing judgment on it, either one way or another, will in no way \nbenefit you. \nSome people undergo the experience of alternating between the positive \nand negative sides of the stream, being at times on the positive side, and at times \non the negative side. The Wall Street crash of '29 swept millions of people from \nthe positive to the negative side of the stream. These millions are struggling, \nsome of them in desperation and fear, to get back to the positive side of the \nstream.

They have to be \n\"attracted.\" \nANYBODY can WISH \nfor riches, and most\npeople do, but only a few\nknow that a definite plan,\nplus a BURNING DESIRE \nfor wealth, are the only\ndependable means of\naccumulating wealth.\nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover  How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n  www.think-and-grow-rich-ebook.com  \n173\n  THINK & GROW RICH   \nCHAPTER 11\nTHE MYSTERY OF SEX TRANSMUTATION\n \nThe Tenth Step toward Riches\nThe meaning of the word \"transmute\" is, in simple language, \"the \nchanging, or transferring of one element, or form of energy, into another.\" \nThe emotion of sex brings into being a state of mind. \nBecause of ignorance on the subject, this state of mind is generally \nassociated with the physical, and because of improper influences, to which most \npeople have been subjected, in acquiring knowledge of sex, things essentially \nphysical have highly biased the mind.\nThe emotion of sex has back of it the possibility of three constructive \npotentialities, they are:— \n1. The perpetuation of mankind.\n2. The maintenance of health, (as a therapeutic agency, it has no equal). \n3. The transformation of mediocrity into genius through transmutation.\nSex transmutation is simple and easily explained. It means the switching \nof the mind from thoughts of physical expression, to thoughts of some other \nnature.\nSex desire is the most powerful of human desires. When driven by this \ndesire, men develop keenness of imagination, courage, will-power, persistence, \nand creative ability unknown to them at other times. So strong and impelling is \nthe desire for sexual contact that men freely run the risk of life and reputation to \nindulge it. When harnessed, and redirected along other lines, this motivating \nforce maintains all of its attributes of keenness of imagination, courage, etc., \nwhich may be used as powerful creative forces in literature, art, or in any other \nprofession or calling, including, of course, the accumulation of riches.\nThe transmutation of sex energy calls for the exercise of will-power, to be \nsure, but the reward is worth the effort. The desire for sexual expression is inborn \nand natural. The desire cannot, and should not be submerged or eliminated. But \nit should be given an outlet through forms of expression which enrich the body, \nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover  How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n  www.think-and-grow-rich-ebook.com  \n174\n  THINK & GROW RICH   \nmind, and spirit of man. If not given this form of outlet, through transmutation, \nit will seek outlets through purely physical channels. \nA river may be dammed, and its water controlled for a time, but \neventually, it will force an outlet. The same is true of the emotion of sex. It may \nbe submerged and controlled for a time, but its very nature causes it to be ever \nseeking means of expression. If it is not transmuted into some creative effort it \nwill find a less worthy outlet. \nFortunate, indeed, is the person who has discovered how to give sex \nemotion an outlet through some form of creative effort, for he has, by that \ndiscovery, lifted himself to the status of a genius.\nScientific research has disclosed these significant facts: \n1. The men of greatest achievement are men with highly developed sex \nnatures; men who have learned the art of sex transmutation. \n2. The men who have accumulated great fortunes and achieved \noutstanding recognition in literature, art, industry, architecture, and the \nprofessions, were motivated by the influence of a woman. \nThe research from which these astounding discoveries were made, went \nback through the pages of biography and history for more than two thousand \nyears. Wherever there was evidence available in connection with the lives of men \nand women of great achievement, it indicated most convincingly that they \npossessed highly developed sex natures. \nThe emotion of sex is an \"irresistible force,\" against which there can be no \nsuch opposition as an \"immovable body.\" When driven by this emotion, men \nbecome gifted with a super power for action. Understand this truth, and you will \ncatch the significance of the statement that sex transmutation will lift one to the \nstatus of a genius. \nThe emotion of sex contains the secret of creative ability. \nDestroy the sex glands, whether in man or beast, and you have removed \nthe major source of action. For proof of this, observe what happens to any animal \nafter it has been castrated. A bull becomes as docile as a cow after it has been \naltered sexually. Sex alteration takes out of the male, whether man or beast, all \nthe FIGHT that was in him. Sex alteration of the female has the same effect. \nTHE TEN MIND STIMULI\nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover  How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n  www.think-and-grow-rich-ebook.com  \n175\n  THINK & GROW RICH   \nThe human mind responds to stimuli, through which it may be \"keyed up\" \nto high rates of vibration, known as enthusiasm, creative imagination, intense \ndesire, etc. The stimuli to which the mind responds most freely are:— \n1. The desire for sex expression \n2. Love \n3. A burning desire for fame, power, or financial gain, MONEY\n4. Music \n5. Friendship between either those of the same sex, or those of the \nopposite sex. \n6. A Master Mind alliance based upon the harmony of two or more people \nwho ally themselves for spiritual or temporal advancement.\n7. Mutual suffering, such as that experienced by people who are \npersecuted. \n8. Auto-suggestion \n9. Fear\n10. Narcotics and alcohol. \nThe desire for sex expression comes at the head of the list of stimuli, which \nmost effectively \"stepup\" the vibrations of the mind and start the \"wheels\" of \nphysical action. Eight of these stimuli are natural and constructive. Two are \ndestructive. The list is here presented for the purpose of enabling you to make a \ncomparative study of the major sources of mind stimulation. From this study, it \nwill be readily seen that the emotion of sex is, by great odds, the most intense \nand powerful of all mind stimuli. \nThis comparison is necessary as a foundation for proof of the statement \nthat transmutation of sex energy may lift one to the status of a genius. Let us find \nout what constitutes a genius. \nSome wiseacre has said that a genius is a man who \"wears long hair, eats \nqueer food, lives alone, and serves as a target for the joke makers.\" A better \ndefinition of a genius is, \"a man who has discovered how to increase the \nvibrations of thought to the point where he can freely communicate with sources \nof knowledge not available through the ordinary rate of vibration of thought.\"\nThe person who thinks will want to ask some questions concerning this \ndefinition of genius. The first question will be, \"How may one communicate with \nsources of knowledge which are not available through the ORDINARY rate of \nvibration of thought?\" \nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover  How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n  www.think-and-grow-rich-ebook.com  \n176\n  THINK & GROW RICH   \nThe next question will be, \"Are there known sources of knowledge which \nare available only to genii, and if so, WHAT ARE THESE SOURCES, and exactly \nhow may they be reached?\" \nWe shall offer proof of the soundness of some of the more important \nstatements made in this book— or at least we shall offer evidence through which \nyou may secure your own proof through experimentation, and in doing so, we \nshall answer both of these questions. \n\"GENIUS\" IS DEVELOPED THROUGH THE \nSIXTH SENSE\nThe reality of a \"sixth sense\" has been fairly well established. This sixth \nsense is \"Creative Imagination.\" The faculty of creative imagination is one which \nthe majority of people never use during an entire lifetime, and if used at all, it \nusually happens by mere accident. A relatively small number of people use, \nWITH DELIBERATION AND PURPOSE AFORETHOUGHT, the faculty of \ncreative imagination. Those who use this faculty voluntarily, and with \nunderstanding of its functions, are GENII.\nThe faculty of creative imagination is the direct link between the finite \nmind of man and Infinite Intelligence. All so-called revelations, referred to in the \nrealm of religion, and all discoveries of basic or new principles in the field of \ninvention, take place through the faculty of creative imagination. \nWhen ideas or concepts flash into one's mind, through what is popularly \ncalled a \"hunch,\" they come from one or more of the following sources:— \n1. Infinite Intelligence \n2. One's subconscious mind, wherein is stored every sense \nimpression and thought impulse which ever reached the brain \nthrough any of the five senses\n3. From the mind of some other person who has just released the \nthought, or picture of the idea or concept, through conscious \nthought, or\n4. From the other person's subconscious storehouse. \nThere are no other KNOWN sources from which \"inspired\" ideas or \n\"hunches\" may be received. \nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover  How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n  www.think-and-grow-rich-ebook.com  \n177\n  THINK & GROW RICH   \nThe creative imagination functions best when the mind is vibrating (due \nto some form of mind stimulation) at an exceedingly high rate. That is, when the \nmind is functioning at a rate of vibration higher than that of ordinary, normal \nthought. \nWhen brain action has been stimulated, through one or more of the ten \nmind stimulants, it has the effect of lifting the individual far above the horizon of \nordinary thought, and permits him to envision distance, scope, and quality of \nTHOUGHTS not available on the lower plane, such as that occupied while one is \nengaged in the solution of the problems of business and professional routine. \nWhen lifted to this higher level of thought, through any form of mind \nstimulation, an individual occupies, relatively, the same position as one who has \nascended in an airplane to a height from which he may see over and beyond the \nhorizon line which limits his vision, while on the ground. Moreover, while on \nthis higher level of thought, the individual is not hampered or bound by any of \nthe stimuli which circumscribe and limit his vision while wrestling with the \nproblems of gaining the three basic necessities of food, clothing, and shelter. He \nis in a world of thought in which the ORDINARY, work-a-day thoughts have \nbeen as effectively removed as are the hills and valleys and other limitations of \nphysical vision, when he rises in an airplane.\nWhile on this exalted plane of THOUGHT, the creative faculty of the mind \nis given freedom for action. The way has been cleared for the sixth sense to \nfunction, it becomes receptive to ideas which could not reach the individual \nunder any other circumstances. The \"sixth sense\" is the faculty which marks the \ndifference between a genius and an ordinary individual. \nThe creative faculty becomes more alert and receptive to vibrations, \noriginating outside the individual's subconscious mind, the more this faculty is \nused, and the more the individual relies upon it, and makes demands upon it for \nthought impulses. This faculty can be cultivated and developed only through \nuse. \nThat which is known as ones conscience operates entirely through the \nfaculty of the sixth sense. \nThe great artists, writers, musicians, and poets become great, because they \nacquire the habit of relying upon the \"still small voice\" which speaks from within, \nthrough the faculty of creative imagination. It is a fact well known to people who \nhave \"keen\" imaginations that their best ideas come through so-called \"hunches.\" \nThere is a great orator who does not attain to greatness, until he closes his \neyes and begins to rely entirely upon the faculty of Creative Imagination.

Gates, of Chevy Chase, Maryland, created more than \n200 useful patents, many of them basic, through the process of cultivating and \nusing the creative faculty. His method is both significant and interesting to one \ninterested in attaining to the status of genius, in which category Dr. Gates, \nunquestionably belonged. Dr. Gates was one of the really great, though less \npublicized scientists of the world.\nIn his laboratory, he had what he called his \"personal communication \nroom.\" It was practically sound proof, and so arranged that all light could be shut \nout. It was equipped with a small table, on which he kept a pad of writing paper. \nIn front of the table, on the wall, was an electric pushbutton, which controlled the \nlights. When Dr. Gates desired to draw upon the forces available to him through \nhis Creative Imagination, he would go into this room, seat himself at the table, \nshut off the lights, and CONCENTRATE upon the KNOWN factors of the \ninvention on which he was working, remaining in that position until ideas began \nto \"flash\" into his mind in connection with the UNKNOWN factors of the \ninvention. \nOn one occasion, ideas came through so fast that he was forced to write \nfor almost three hours. When the thoughts stopped flowing, and he examined his \nnotes, he found they contained a minute description of principles which bad not \na parallel among the known data of the scientific world. \nMoreover, the answer to his problem was intelligently presented in those \nnotes. In this manner Dr. Gates completed over 200 patents, which had been \nbegun, but not completed, by \"half-baked\" brains. Evidence of the truth of this \nstatement is in the United States Patent Office. \nDr. Gates earned his living by \"sitting for ideas\" for individuals and \ncorporations. Some of the largest corporations in America paid him substantial \nfees, by the hour, for \"sitting for ideas.\" \nThe reasoning faculty is often faulty, because it is largely guided by one's \naccumulated experience.

The \nscientific inventor (such as Mr. Edison, and Dr. Gates), makes use of both the \nsynthetic and the creative faculties of imagination. \nFor example, the scientific inventor, or \"genius, begins an invention by \norganizing and combining the known ideas, or principles accumulated through \nexperience, through the synthetic faculty (the reasoning faculty). If he finds this \naccumulated knowledge to be insufficient for the completion of his invention, he \nthen draws upon the sources of knowledge available to him through his creative \nfaculty. The method by which he does this varies with the individual, but this is \nthe sum and substance of his procedure: \n1.\nHE STIMULATES HIS MIND SO THAT IT VIBRATES ON A HIGHER-\nTHAN-AVERAGE PLANE, using one or more of the ten mind stimulants or \nsome other stimulant of his choice. \n2.\nHE CONCENTRATES upon the known factors (the finished part) of his \ninvention, and creates in his mind a perfect picture of unknown factors (the \nunfinished part), of his invention. He holds this picture in mind until it has been \ntaken over by the subconscious mind, then relaxes by clearing his mind of ALL \nthought, and waits for his answer to \"flash\" into his mind.\nSometimes the results are both definite and immediate. At other times, the \nresults are negative, depending upon the state of development of the \"sixth \nsense,\" or creative faculty.\nMr. Edison tried out more than 10,000 different combinations of ideas \nthrough the synthetic faculty of his imagination before he \"tuned in\" through the \ncreative faculty, and got the answer which perfected the incandescent light. His \nexperience was similar when he produced the talking machine. \nThere is plenty of reliable evidence that the faculty of creative imagination \nexists. This evidence is available through accurate analysis of men who have \nbecome leaders in their respective callings, without having had extensive \neducations. Lincoln was a notable example of a great leader who achieved \ngreatness, through the discovery, and use of his faculty of creative imagination. \nHe discovered, and began to use this faculty as the result of the stimulation of \nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover  How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n  www.think-and-grow-rich-ebook.com  \n180\n  THINK & GROW RICH   \nlove which he experienced after he met Anne Rutledge, a statement of the \nhighest significance, in connection with the study of the source of genius. \nThe pages of history are filled with the records of great leaders whose \nachievements may be traced directly to the influence of women who aroused the \ncreative faculties of their minds, through the stimulation of sex desire. Napoleon \nBonaparte was one of these. When inspired by his first wife, Josephine, he was \nirresistible and invincible. When his \"better judgment\" or reasoning faculty \nprompted him to put Josephine aside, he began to decline. His defeat and St. \nHelena were not far distant.\nIf good taste would permit, we might easily mention scores of men, well \nknown to the American people, who climbed to great heights of achievement \nunder the stimulating influence of their wives, only to drop back to destruction \nAFTER money and power went to their heads, and they put aside the old wife \nfor a new one. Napoleon was not the only man to discover that sex influence, \nfrom the right source, is more powerful than any substitute of expediency, which \nmay be created by mere reason. \nThe human mind responds to stimulation! \nAmong the greatest, and most powerful of these stimuli is the urge of sex. \nWhen harnessed and transmuted, this driving force is capable of lifting men into \nthat higher sphere of thought which enables them to master the sources of worry \nand petty annoyance which beset their pathway on the lower plane. \nUnfortunately, only the genii have made the discovery. Others have \naccepted the experience of sex urge, without discovering one of its major \npotentialities— a fact which accounts for the great number of \"others\" as \ncompared to the limited number of genii. \nFor the purpose of refreshing the memory, in connection with the facts \navailable from the biographies of certain men, we here present the names of a \nfew men of outstanding achievement, each of whom was known to have been of \na highly sexed nature.

There never has been, and never \nwill be a great leader, builder, or artist lacking in this driving force of sex. \nSurely no one will misunderstand these statements to mean that ALL who \nare highly sexed are genii! Man attains to the status of a genius ONLY when, and \nIF, he stimulates his mind so that it draws upon the forces available, through the \ncreative faculty of the imagination. Chief among the stimuli with which this \n\"stepping up\" of the vibrations may be produced is sex energy. The mere \npossession of this energy is not sufficient to produce a genius. The energy must be \ntransmuted from desire for physical contact, into some other form of desire and \naction, before it will lift one to the status of a genius. \nFar from becoming genii, because of great sex desires, the majority of men \nlower themselves, through misunderstanding and misuse of this great force, to \nthe status of the lower animals. \nWHY MEN SELDOM SUCCEED BEFORE FORTY\nI discovered, from the analysis of over 25,000 people, that men who \nsucceed in an outstanding way, seldom do so before the age of forty, and more \noften they do not strike their real pace until they are well beyond the age of fifty. \nThis fact was so astounding that it prompted me to go into the study of its cause \nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover  How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n  www.think-and-grow-rich-ebook.com  \n182\n  THINK & GROW RICH   \nmost carefully, carrying the investigation over a period of more than twelve \nyears. \nThis study disclosed the fact that the major reason why the majority of \nmen who succeed do not begin to do so before the age of forty to fifty, is their \ntendency to DISSIPATE their energies through over indulgence in physical \nexpression of the emotion of sex. The majority of men never learn that the urge of \nsex has other possibilities, which far transcend in importance, that of mere \nphysical expression. The majority of those who make this discovery, do so after \nhaving wasted many years at a period when the sex energy is at its height, prior to \nthe age of forty-five to fifty. This usually is followed by noteworthy achievement.\nThe lives of many men up to, and sometimes well past the age of forty, \nreflect a continued dissipation of energies, which could have been more \nprofitably turned into better channels. Their finer and more powerful emotions \nare sown wildly to the four winds. Out of this habit of the male, grew the term, \n\"sowing his wild oats.\" \nThe desire for sexual expression is by far the strongest and most impelling \nof all the human emotions, and for this very reason this desire, when harnessed \nand transmuted into action, other than that of physical expression, may raise one \nto the status of a genius. \nOne of America's most able business men frankly admitted that his \nattractive secretary was responsible for most of the plans he created. He admitted \nthat her presence lifted him to heights of creative imagination, such as he could \nexperience under no other stimulus.\nOne of the most successful men in America owes most of his success to the \ninfluence of a very charming young woman, who has served as his source of \ninspiration for more than twelve years. Everyone knows the man to whom this \nreference is made, but not everyone knows the REAL SOURCE of his \nachievements. \nHistory is not lacking in examples of men who attained to the status of \ngenii, as the result of the use of artificial mind stimulants in the form of alcohol \nand narcotics. Edgar Allen Poe wrote the \"Raven\" while under the influence of \nliquor, \"dreaming dreams that mortal never dared to dream before.\" James \nWhitcomb Riley did his best writing while under the influence of alcohol. \nPerhaps it was thus he saw \"the ordered intermingling of the real and the dream, \nthe mill above the river, and the mist above the stream.\" Robert Burns wrote best \nwhen intoxicated, \"For Auld Lang Syne, my dear, we'll take a cup of kindness \nyet, for Auld Lang Syne.\" \nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover  How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n  www.think-and-grow-rich-ebook.com  \n183\n  THINK & GROW RICH   \nBut let it be remembered that many such men have destroyed themselves \nin the end. Nature has prepared her own potions with which men may safely \nstimulate their minds so they vibrate on a plane that enables them to tune in to \nfine and rare thoughts which come from— no man knows where! No satisfactory \nsubstitute for Nature's stimulants has ever been found. \nIt is a fact well known to psychologists that there is a very close \nrelationship between sex desires and spiritual urges— a fact which accounts for \nthe peculiar behavior of people who participate in the orgies known as religious \n\"revivals,\" common among the primitive types. \nThe world is ruled, and the destiny of civilization is established, by the \nhuman emotions. People are influenced in their actions, not by reason so much as \nby \"feelings.\" The creative faculty of the mind is set into action entirely by \nemotions, and not by cold reason. The most powerful of all human emotions is that \nof sex. There are other mind stimulants, some of which have been listed, but no \none of them, nor all of them combined, can equal the driving power of sex.\nA mind stimulant is any influence which will either temporarily, or \npermanently, increase the vibrations of thought. The ten major stimulants, \ndescribed, are those most commonly resorted to. Through these sources one may \ncommune with Infinite Intelligence, or enter, at will, the storehouse of the \nsubconscious mind, either one's own, or that of another person, a procedure \nwhich is all there is of genius.\nA teacher, who has trained and directed the efforts of more than 30,000 \nsales people, made the astounding discovery that highly sexed men are the most \nefficient salesmen. The explanation is, that the factor of personality known as \n\"personal magnetism\" is nothing more nor less than sex energy. Highly sexed \npeople always have a plentiful supply of magnetism. Through cultivation and \nunderstanding, this vital force may be drawn upon and used to great advantage \nin the relationships between people. This energy may be communicated to others \nthrough the following media: \n1.\nThe hand-shake. The touch of the hand indicates, instantly, the presence of \nmagnetism, or the lack of it.\n2.\nThe tone of voice.

People who are highly sexed are usually very careful \nabout their personal appearance. They usually select clothing of a style becoming \nto their personality, physique, complexion, etc. \nWhen employing salesmen, the more capable sales manager looks for the \nquality of personal magnetism as the first requirement of a salesman. People who \nlack sex energy will never become enthusiastic nor inspire others with \nenthusiasm, and enthusiasm is one of the most important requisites in \nsalesmanship, no matter what one is selling. \nThe public speaker, orator, preacher, lawyer, or salesman who is lacking \nin sex energy is a \"flop,\" as far as being able to influence others is concerned. \nCouple with this the fact, that most people can be influenced only through an \nappeal to their emotions, and you will understand the importance of sex energy \nas a part of the salesman's native ability. Master salesmen attain the status of \nmastery in selling, because they, either consciously, or unconsciously, transmute \nthe energy of sex into SALES ENTHUSIASM! In this statement may be found a \nvery practical suggestion as to the actual meaning of sex transmutation.\nThe salesman who knows how to take his mind off the subject of sex, and \ndirect it in sales effort with as much enthusiasm and determination as he would \napply to its original purpose, has acquired the art of sex transmutation, whether \nhe knows it or not. The majority of salesmen who transmute their sex energy do \nso without being in the least aware of what they are doing, or how they are doing \nit. \nTransmutation of sex energy calls for more will power than the average \nperson cares to use for this purpose. Those who find it difficult to summon will-\npower sufficient for transmutation, may gradually acquire this ability. Though \nthis requires will-power, the reward for the practice is more than worth the \neffort. \nThe entire subject of sex is one with which the majority of people appear \nto be unpardonably ignorant. The urge of sex has been grossly misunderstood, \nslandered, and burlesqued by the ignorant and the evil minded, for so long that \nthe very word sex is seldom used in polite society.

Instead of being called \nblessed, they are usually called cursed.\nMillions of people, even in this age of enlightenment, have inferiority \ncomplexes which they developed because of this false belief that a highly sexed \nnature is a curse. These statements, of the virtue of sex energy, should not be \nconstrued as justification for the libertine. The emotion of sex is a virtue ONLY \nwhen used intelligently, and with discrimination. It may be misused, and often \nis, to such an extent that it debases, instead of enriches, both body and mind. The \nbetter use of this power is the burden of this chapter.\nIt seemed quite significant to the author, when he made the discovery that \npractically every great leader, whom he had the privilege of analyzing, was a \nman whose achievements were largely inspired by a woman. In many instances, \nthe \"woman in the case\" was a modest, self-denying wife, of whom the public \nhad heard but little or nothing. In a few instances, the source of inspiration has \nbeen traced to the \"other woman.\" Perhaps such cases may not be entirely \nunknown to you. \nIntemperance in sex habits is just as detrimental as intemperance in habits \nof drinking and eating. In this age in which we live, an age which began with the \nworld war, intemperance in habits of sex is common. This orgy of indulgence \nmay account for the shortage of great leaders. No man can avail himself of the \nforces of his creative imagination, while dissipating them. Man is the only \ncreature on earth which violates Nature's purpose in this connection. Every other \nanimal indulges its sex nature in moderation, and with purpose which \nharmonizes with the laws of nature. Every other animal responds to the call of \nsex only in \"season.\" Man's inclination is to declare \"open season.\"\nEvery intelligent person knows that stimulation in excess, through \nalcoholic drink and narcotics, is a form of intemperance which destroys the vital \norgans of the body, including the brain. Not every person knows, however, that \nover indulgence in sex expression may become a habit as destructive and as \ndetrimental to creative effort as narcotics or liquor.\nA sex-mad man is not essentially different than a dope-mad man!

The \nconspiracy of mystery and silence has had the same effect upon the minds of \nyoung people that the psychology of prohibition had. The result has been \nincreased curiosity, and desire to acquire more knowledge on this \"verboten\" \nsubject; and to the shame of all lawmakers, and most physicians— by training \nbest qualified to educate youth on that subject-information has not been easily \navailable.\nSeldom does an individual enter upon highly creative effort in any field of \nendeavor before the age of forty. The average man reaches the period of his \ngreatest capacity to create between forty and sixty. These statements are based \nupon analysis of thousands of men and women who have been carefully \nobserved. They should be encouraging to those who fail to arrive before the age \nof forty, and to those who become frightened at the approach of \"old age,\" \naround the forty-year mark. The years between forty and fifty are, as a rule, the \nmost fruitful. Man should approach this age, not with fear and trembling, but \nwith hope and eager anticipation.\nIf you want evidence that most men do not begin to do their best work \nbefore the age of forty, study the records of the most successful men known to \nthe American people, and you will find it. Henry Ford had not \"hit his pace\" of \nachievement until he had passed the age of forty. Andrew Carnegie was well \npast forty before he began to reap the reward of his efforts. James J. Hill was still \nrunning a telegraph key at the age of forty. His stupendous achievements took \nplace after that age. Biographies of American industrialists and financiers are \nfilled with evidence that the period from forty to sixty is the most productive age \nof man. \nBetween the ages of thirty and forty, man begins to learn (if he ever \nlearns), the art of sex transmutation. This discovery is generally accidental, and \nmore often than otherwise, the man who makes it is totally unconscious of his \ndiscovery.

When the emotion of love begins to mix itself with \nthe emotion of sex, the result is calmness of purpose, poise, accuracy of \njudgment, and balance. What person, who has attained to the age of forty, is so \nunfortunate as to be unable to analyze these statements, and to corroborate them \nby his own experience? \nWhen driven by his desire to please a woman, based solely upon the \nemotion of sex, a man may be, and usually is, capable of great achievement, but \nhis actions may be disorganized, distorted, and totally destructive. When driven \nby his desire to please a woman, based upon the motive of sex alone, a man may \nsteal, cheat, and even commit murder. But when the emotion of LOVE is mixed \nwith the emotion of sex, that same man will guide his actions with more sanity, \nbalance, and reason. \nCriminologists have discovered that the most hardened criminals can be \nreformed through the influence of a woman's love. There is no record of a \ncriminal having been reformed solely through the sex influence. These facts are \nwell known, but their cause is not. Reformation comes, if at all, through the heart, \nor the emotional side of man, not through his head, or reasoning side. \nReformation means, \"a change of heart.\" It does not mean a \"change of head.\" A \nman may, because of reason, make certain changes in his personal conduct to \navoid the consequences of undesirable effects, but GENUINE REFORMATION \ncomes only through a change of heart—through a DESIRE to change.\nLove, Romance, and Sex are all emotions capable of driving men to \nheights of super achievement. Love is the emotion which serves as a safety valve, \nand insures balance, poise, and constructive effort. When combined, these three \nemotions may lift one to an altitude of a genius. There are genii, however, who \nknow but little of the emotion of love. Most of them may be found engaged in \nsome form of action which is destructive, or at least, not based upon justice and \nfairness toward others. If good taste would permit, a dozen genii could be named \nin the field of industry and finance, who ride ruthlessly over the rights of their \nfellow men. They seem totally lacking in conscience. The reader can easily \nsupply his own list of such men.\nThe emotions are states of mind.

The emotions \nmay, likewise, be combined so as to create a deadly poison. The emotions of sex \nand jealousy, when mixed, may turn a person into an insane beast. \nThe presence of any one or more of the destructive emotions in the human \nmind, through the chemistry of the mind, sets up a poison which may destroy \none's sense of justice and fairness. In extreme cases, the presence of any \ncombination of these emotions in the mind may destroy one's reason. \nThe road to genius consists of the development, control, and use of sex, \nlove, and romance. Briefly, the process may be stated as follows: \nEncourage the presence of these emotions as the dominating thoughts in \none's mind, and discourage the presence of all the destructive emotions. The \nmind is a creature of habit. It thrives upon the dominating thoughts fed it. \nThrough the faculty of will-power, one may discourage the presence of any \nemotion, and encourage the presence of any other. Control of the mind, through \nthe power of will, is not difficult. Control comes from persistence, and habit. The \nsecret of control lies in understanding the process of transmutation. When any \nnegative emotion presents itself in one's mind, it can be transmuted into a \npositive, or constructive emotion, by the simple procedure of changing one's \nthoughts.\nTHERE IS NO OTHER ROAD TO GENIUS THAN THROUGH \nVOLUNTARY SELF EFFORT! A man may attain to great heights of financial or \nbusiness achievement, solely by the driving force of sex energy, but history is \nfilled with evidence that he may, and usually does, carry with him certain traits \nof character which rob him of the ability to either hold, or enjoy his fortune. This \nis worthy of analysis, thought, and meditation, for it states a truth, the \nknowledge of which may be helpful to women as well as men. Ignorance of this \nhas cost thousands of people their privilege of HAPPINESS, even though they \npossessed riches. \nThe emotions of love and sex leave their unmistakable marks upon the \nfeatures. Moreover, these signs are so visible, that all who wish may read them. \nThe man who is driven by the storm of passion, based upon sex desires alone, \nplainly advertises that fact to the entire world, by the expression of his eyes, and \nthe lines of his face. The emotion of love, when mixed with the emotion of sex, \nsoftens, modifies, and beautifies the facial expression.

It leaves its impress upon one's very soul, even after the fire has \nbeen subdued by time and circumstance. \nMemories of love never pass. They linger, guide, and influence long after \nthe source of stimulation has faded. There is nothing new in this. Every person, \nwho has been moved by GENUINE LOVE, knows that it leaves enduring traces \nupon the human heart. The effect of love endures, because love is spiritual in \nnature. The man who cannot be stimulated to great heights of achievement by \nlove, is hopeless—he is dead, though he may seem to live. \nEven the memories of love are sufficient to lift one to a higher plane of \ncreative effort. The major force of love may spend itself and pass away, like a fire \nwhich has burned itself out, but it leaves behind indelible marks as evidence that \nit passed that way. Its departure often prepares the human heart for a still greater \nlove.\nGo back into your yesterdays, at times, and bathe your mind in the \nbeautiful memories of past love. It will soften the influence of the present worries \nand annoyances. It will give you a source of escape from the unpleasant realities \nof life, and maybe—who knows?—your mind will yield to you, during this \ntemporary retreat into the world of fantasy, ideas, or plans which may change \nthe entire financial or spiritual status of your life. \nIf you believe yourself unfortunate, because you have \"loved and lost,\" \nperish the thought. One who has loved truly, can never lose entirely. Love is \nwhimsical and temperamental. Its nature is ephemeral, and transitory. It comes \nwhen it pleases, and goes away without warning. Accept and enjoy it while it \nremains, but spend no time worrying about its departure. Worry will never bring \nit back. \nDismiss, also, the thought that love never comes but once. Love may come \nand go, times without number, but there are no two love experiences which \naffect one in just the same way. There may be, and there usually is, one love \nexperience which leaves a deeper imprint on the heart than all the others, but all \nlove experiences are beneficial, except to the person who becomes resentful and \ncynical when love makes its departure. \nThere should be no disappointment over love, and there would be none if \npeople understood the difference between the emotions of love and sex. The \nmajor difference is that love is spiritual, while sex is biological. No experience, \nwhich touches the human heart with a spiritual force, can possibly be harmful, \nexcept through ignorance, or jealousy. \nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover  How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n  www.think-and-grow-rich-ebook.com  \n190\n  THINK & GROW RICH   \nLove is, without question, life's greatest experience. It brings one into \ncommunion with Infinite Intelligence. When mixed with the emotions of \nromance and sex, it may lead one far up the ladder of creative effort. The \nemotions of love, sex, and romance, are sides of the eternal triangle of \nachievement-building genius. Nature creates genii through no other force.\nLove is an emotion with many sides, shades, and colors. The love which \none feels for parents, or children is quite different from that which one feels for \none's sweetheart. The one is mixed with the emotion of sex, while the other is \nnot. \nThe love which one feels in true friendship is not the same as that felt for \none's sweetheart, parents, or children, but it, too, is a form of love. \nThen, there is the emotion of love for things inanimate, such as the love of \nNature's handiwork. But the most intense and burning of all these various kinds \nof love, is that experienced in the blending of the emotions of love and sex. \nMarriages, not blessed with the eternal affinity of love, properly balanced and \nproportioned, with sex, cannot be happy ones—and seldom endure. Love, alone, \nwill not bring happiness in marriage, nor will sex alone. When these two \nbeautiful emotions are blended, marriage may bring about a state of mind, \nclosest to the spiritual that one may ever know on this earthly plane.\nWhen the emotion of romance is added to those of love and sex, the \nobstructions between the finite mind of man and Infinite Intelligence are \nremoved. \nThen a genius has been born! \nWhat a different story is this, than those usually associated with the \nemotion of sex. Here is an interpretation of the emotion which lifts it out of the \ncommonplace, and makes of it potter's clay in the hands of God, from which He \nfashions all that is beautiful and inspiring. It is an interpretation which would, \nwhen properly understood, bring harmony out of the chaos which exists in too \nmany marriages. The disharmonies often expressed in the form of nagging, may \nusually be traced to lack of knowledge on the subject of sex. Where love, romance \nand the proper understanding of the emotion and function of sex abide, there is \nno disharmony between married people. \nFortunate is the husband whose wife understands the true relationship \nbetween the emotions of love, sex, and romance.

The \"making\" and \"breaking\" is \nthe result of the wife's understanding, or lack of understanding of the emotions \nof love, sex, and romance. \nDespite the fact that men are polygamous, by the very nature of their \nbiological inheritance, it is true that no woman has as great an influence on a \nman as his wife, unless he is married to a woman totally unsuited to his nature. If \na woman permits her husband to lose interest in her, and become more \ninterested in other women, it is usually because of her ignorance, or indifference \ntoward the subjects of sex, love, and romance. This statement presupposes, of \ncourse, that genuine love once existed between a man and his wife. The facts are \nequally applicable to a man who permits his wife's interest in him to die.\nMarried people often bicker over a multitude of trivialities. If these are \nanalyzed accurately, the real cause of the trouble will often be found to be \nindifference, or ignorance on these subjects.\nMan's greatest motivating force is his desire to please woman! The hunter who \nexcelled during prehistoric days, before the dawn of civilization, did so, because \nof his desire to appear great in the eyes of woman. Man's nature has not changed \nin this respect. The \"hunter\" of today brings home no skins of wild animals, but \nhe indicates his desire for her favor by supplying fine clothes, motor cars, and \nwealth. Man has the same desire to please woman that he had before the dawn of \ncivilization. The only thing that has changed, is his method of pleasing. Men who \naccumulate large fortunes, and attain to great heights of power and fame, do so, \nmainly, to satisfy their desire to please women. \nTake women out of their lives, and great wealth would be useless to most \nmen. It is this inherent desire of man to please woman, which gives woman the power to \nmake or break a man. \nThe woman who understands man's nature and tactfully caters to it, need \nhave no fear of competition from other women. Men may be \"giants\" with \nindomitable will-power when dealing with other men, but they are easily \nmanaged by the women of their choice. \nMost men will not admit that they are easily influenced by the women \nthey prefer, because it is in the nature of the male to want to be recognized as the \nstronger of the species.

You may VOLUNTARILY plant in your subconscious mind any plan, \nthought, or purpose which you desire to translate into its physical or monetary \nequivalent. The subconscious acts first on the dominating desires which have \nbeen mixed with emotional feeling, such as faith. \nConsider this in connection with the instructions given in the chapter on \nDESIRE, for taking the six steps there outlined, and the instructions given in the \nchapter on the building and execution of plans, and you will understand the \nimportance of the thought conveyed. \nTHE SUBCONSCIOUS MIND WORKS DAY AND NIGHT. Through a \nmethod of procedure, unknown to man, the subconscious mind draws upon the \nforces of Infinite Intelligence for the power with which it voluntarily transmutes \none's desires into their physical equivalent, making use, always of the most \npractical media by which this end may be accomplished.\nYou cannot entirely control your subconscious mind, but you can \nvoluntarily hand over to it any plan, desire, or purpose which you wish \ntransformed into concrete form. Read, again, instructions for using the \nsubconscious mind, in the chapter on autosuggestion.\nThere is plenty of evidence to support the belief that the subconscious \nmind is the connecting link between the finite mind of man and Infinite \nIntelligence. It is the intermediary through which one may draw upon the forces \nof Infinite Intelligence at will. It, alone, contains the secret process by which \nmental impulses are modified and changed into their spiritual equivalent.

They inspire one with awe.\nI never approach the discussion of the subconscious mind without a \nfeeling of littleness and inferiority due, perhaps, to the fact that man's entire \nstock of knowledge on this subject is so pitifully limited. The very fact that the \nsubconscious mind is the medium of communication between the thinking mind \nof man and Infinite Intelligence is, of itself, a thought which almost paralyzes \none's reason.\nAfter you have accepted, as a reality, the existence of the subconscious \nmind, and understand its possibilities, as a medium for transmuting your \nDESIRES into their physical or monetary equivalent, you will comprehend the \nfull significance of the instructions given in the chapter on DESIRE. You will also \nunderstand why you have been repeatedly admonished to MAKE YOUR \nDESIRES CLEAR, AND TO REDUCE THEM TO WRITING. You will also \nunderstand the necessity of PERSISTENCE in carrying out instructions. \nThe thirteen principles are the stimuli with which you acquire the ability \nto reach, and to influence your subconscious mind. Do not become discouraged, \nif you cannot do this upon the first attempt. Remember that the subconscious \nmind may be voluntarily directed only through habit, under the directions given in \nthe chapter on FAITH. You have not yet had time to master faith. Be patient. Be \npersistent. \nA good many statements in the chapters on faith and auto-suggestion will \nbe repeated here, for the benefit of YOUR subconscious mind. Remember, your \nsubconscious mind functions voluntarily, whether you make any effort to influence it \nor not. This, naturally, suggests to you that thoughts of fear and poverty, and all \nnegative thoughts serve as stimuli to your subconscious mind, unless, you master \nthese impulses and give it more desirable food upon which it may feed.\nThe subconscious mind will not remain idle! If you fail to plant DESIRES \nin your subconscious mind, it will feed upon the thoughts which reach it as the \nresult of your neglect. We have already explained that thought impulses, both \nnegative and positive are reaching the subconscious mind continuously, from the \nfour sources which were mentioned in the chapter on Sex Transmutation. \nFor the present, it is sufficient if you remember that you are living daily, in \nthe midst of all manner of thought impulses which are reaching your \nsubconscious mind, without your knowledge.

You are now engaged in trying to help shut off the \nflow of negative impulses, and to aid in voluntarily influencing your \nsubconscious mind, through positive impulses of DESIRE.\nWhen you achieve this, you will possess the key which unlocks the door \nto your subconscious mind. Moreover, you will control that door so completely, \nthat no undesirable thought may influence your subconscious mind.\nEverything which man creates, BEGINS in the form of a thought impulse. \nMan can create nothing which he does not first conceive in THOUGHT. Through \nthe aid of the imagination, thought impulses may be assembled into plans. The \nimagination, when under control, may be used for the creation of plans or \npurposes that lead to success in one's chosen occupation.\nAll thought impulses, intended for transmutation into their physical \nequivalent, voluntarily planted in the subconscious mind, must pass through the \nimagination, and be mixed with faith. The \"mixing\" of faith with a plan, or \npurpose, intended for submission to the subconscious mind, may be done ONLY \nthrough the imagination.\nFrom these statements, you will readily observe that voluntary use of the \nsubconscious mind calls for coordination and application of all the principles.\nElla Wheeler Wilcox gave evidence of her understanding of the power of \nthe subconscious mind when she wrote: \n\"You never can tell what a thought will do\nIn bringing you hate or love—\nFor thoughts are things, and their airy wings\nAre swifter than carrier doves.\nThey follow the law of the universe—\nEach thing creates its kind, \nAnd they speed O'er the track to bring you back \nWhatever went out from your mind.\"\nMrs. Wilcox understood the truth, that thoughts which go out from one's \nmind, also imbed themselves deeply in one's subconscious mind, where they \nserve as a magnet, pattern, or blueprint by which the subconscious mind is \ninfluenced while translating them into their physical equivalent.

In fact, there is much evidence to support the \ntheory, that ONLY emotionalized thoughts have any ACTION influence upon \nthe subconscious mind. It is a well known fact that emotion or feeling, rules the \nmajority of people. If it is true that the subconscious mind responds more quickly \nto, and is influenced more readily by thought impulses which are well mixed \nwith emotion, it is essential to become familiar with the more important of the \nemotions.

The positives must be injected, \nthrough the principle of auto-suggestion, into the thought impulses which an \nindividual wishes to pass on to his subconscious mind. (Instructions have been \ngiven in the chapter on auto-suggestion.)\nThese emotions, or feeling impulses, may be likened to yeast in a loaf of \nbread, because they constitute the ACTION element, which transforms thought \nimpulses from the passive to the active state. Thus may one understand why \nthought impulses, which have been well mixed with emotion, are acted upon \nmore readily than thought impulses originating in \"cold reason.\"\nYou are preparing yourself to influence and control the \"inner audience\" \nof your subconscious mind, in order to hand over to it the DESIRE for money, \nwhich you wish transmuted into its monetary equivalent.

Only in this way, can \nthe vibration of sound be communicated through the ether. After this \ntransformation has taken place, the ether \"picks up\" the energy (which originally \nwas in the form of vibrations of sound), carries that energy to radio receiving \nstations, and these receiving sets \"step\" that energy back down to its original rate \nof vibration so it is recognized as sound.\nThe subconscious mind is the intermediary, which translates one's prayers \ninto terms which Infinite Intelligence can recognize, presents the message, and \nbrings back the answer in the form of a definite plan or idea for procuring the \nobject of the prayer. Understand this principle, and you will know why mere \nwords read from a prayer book cannot, and will never serve as an agency of \ncommunication between the mind of man and Infinite Intelligence. \nBefore your prayer will reach Infinite Intelligence (a statement of the \nauthor's theory only), it probably is transformed from its original thought \nvibration into terms of spiritual vibration. Faith is the only known agency which \nwill give your thoughts a spiritual nature. FAITH and FEAR make poor \nbedfellows. Where one is found, the other cannot exist. \nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover  How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n  www.think-and-grow-rich-ebook.com  \n200\n  THINK & GROW RICH   \nCHAPTER 13\nTHE BRAIN\nA BROADCASTING AND RECEIVING STATION FOR THOUGHT\nThe Twelfth Step toward Riches\nMORE than twenty years ago, the author, working in conjunction with the \nlate Dr. Alexander Graham Bell, and Dr. Elmer R. Gates, observed that every \nhuman brain is both a broadcasting and receiving station for the vibration of \nthought. \nThrough the medium of the ether, in a fashion similar to that employed by \nthe radio broadcasting principle, every human brain is capable of picking up \nvibrations of thought which are being released by other brains. \nIn connection with the statement in the preceding paragraph, compare, \nand consider the description of the Creative Imagination, as outlined in the \nchapter on Imagination. The Creative Imagination is the \"receiving set\" of the \nbrain, which receives thoughts, released by the brains of others. It is the agency \nof communication between one's conscious, or reasoning mind, and the four \nsources from which one may receive thought stimuli. \nWhen stimulated, or \"stepped up\" to a high rate of vibration, the mind \nbecomes more receptive to the vibration of thought which reaches it through the \nether from outside sources. This \"stepping up\" process takes place through the \npositive emotions, or the negative emotions. Through the emotions, the \nvibrations of thought may be increased.\nVibrations of an exceedingly high rate are the only vibrations picked up \nand carried, by the ether, from one brain to another. Thought is energy travelling \nat an exceedingly high rate of vibration. Thought, which has been modified or \n\"stepped up\" by any of the major emotions, vibrates at a much higher rate than \nordinary thought, and it is this type of thought which passes from one brain to \nanother, through the broadcasting machinery of the human brain. \nThe emotion of sex stands at the head of the list of human emotions, as far \nas intensity and driving force are concerned. The brain which has been \nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover  How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n  www.think-and-grow-rich-ebook.com  \n201\n  THINK & GROW RICH   \nstimulated by the emotion of sex, vibrates at a much more rapid rate than it does \nwhen that emotion is quiescent or absent. \nThe result of sex transmutation, is the increase of the rate of vibration of \nthoughts to such a pitch that the Creative Imagination becomes highly receptive \nto ideas, which it picks up from the ether. On the other hand, when the brain is \nvibrating at a rapid rate, it not only attracts thoughts and ideas released by other \nbrains through the medium of the ether, but it gives to one's own thoughts that \n\"feeling\" which is essential before those thoughts will be picked up and acted \nupon by one's subconscious mind.\nThus, you will see that the broadcasting principle is the factor through \nwhich you mix feeling, or emotion with your thoughts and pass them on to your \nsubconscious mind.\nThe subconscious mind is the \"sending station\" of the brain, through \nwhich vibrations of thought are broadcast. The Creative Imagination is the \n\"receiving set,\" through which the vibrations of thought are picked up from the \nether. \nAlong with the important factors of the subconscious mind, and the \nfaculty of the Creative Imagination, which constitute the sending and receiving \nsets of your mental broadcasting machinery, consider now the principle of auto-\nsuggestion, which is the medium by which you may put into operation your \n\"broadcasting\" station.\nThrough the instructions described in the chapter on auto-suggestion, you \nwere definitely informed of the method by which DESIRE may be transmuted \ninto its monetary equivalent.\nOperation of your mental \"broadcasting\" station is a comparatively simple \nprocedure. You have but three principles to bear in mind, and to apply, when \nyou wish to use your broadcasting station—the SUBCONSCIOUS MIND, \nCREATIVE IMAGINATION, and AUTO-SUGGESTION. The stimuli through \nwhich you put these three principles into action have been described— the \nprocedure begins with DESIRE.\nTHE GREATEST FORCES ARE \"INTANGIBLE\"\nThe depression brought the world to the very border-line of \nunderstanding of the forces which are intangible and unseen. Through the ages \nwhich have passed, man has depended too much upon his physical senses, and \nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover  How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n  www.think-and-grow-rich-ebook.com  \n202\n  THINK & GROW RICH   \nhas limited his knowledge to physical things, which he could see, touch, weigh, \nand measure. \nWe are now entering the most marvelous of all ages—an age which will \nteach us something of the intangible forces of the world about us. Perhaps we \nshall learn, as we pass through this age, that the \"other self\" is more powerful \nthan the physical self we see when we look into a mirror. \nSometimes men speak lightly of the intangibles— the things which they \ncannot perceive through any of their five senses, and when we hear them, it \nshould remind us that all of us are controlled by forces which are unseen and \nintangible.\nThe whole of mankind has not the power to cope with, nor to control the \nintangible force wrapped up in the rolling waves of the oceans. Man has not the \ncapacity to understand the intangible force of gravity, which keeps this little \nearth suspended in mid-air, and keeps man from falling from it, much less the \npower to control that force. Man is entirely subservient to the intangible force \nwhich comes with a thunder storm, and he is just as helpless in the presence of \nthe intangible force of electricity— nay, he does not even know what electricity \nis, where it comes from, or what is its purpose! \nNor is this by any means the end of man's ignorance in connection with \nthings unseen and intangible. He does not understand the intangible force (and \nintelligence) wrapped up in the soil of the earth— the force which provides him \nwith every morsel of food he eats, every article of clothing he wears, every dollar he \ncarries in his pockets. \nTHE DRAMATIC STORY OF THE BRAIN\nLast, but not least, man, with all of his boasted culture and education, \nunderstands little or nothing of the intangible force (the greatest of all the \nintangibles) of thought. He knows but little concerning the physical brain, and its \nvast network of intricate machinery through which the power of thought is \ntranslated into its material equivalent, but he is now entering an age which shall \nyield enlightenment on the subject. Already men of science have begun to turn \ntheir attention to the study of this stupendous thing called a brain, and, while \nthey are still in the kindergarten stage of their studies, they have uncovered \nenough knowledge to know that the central switchboard of the human brain, the \nnumber of lines which connect the brain cells one with another, equal the figure \none, followed by fifteen million ciphers. \nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover  How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n  www.think-and-grow-rich-ebook.com  \n203\n  THINK & GROW RICH   \n\"The figure is so stupendous,\" said Dr. C. Judson Herrick, of the \nUniversity of Chicago, \"that astronomical figures dealing with hundreds of \nmillions of light years, become insignificant by comparison.\nIt has been determined that there are from 10,000,000,000 to 14,000,000,000 \nnerve cells in the human cerebral cortex, and we know that these are arranged in \ndefinite patterns. These arrangements are not haphazard. They are orderly. \nRecently developed methods of electro-physiology draw off action currents from \nvery precisely located cells, or fibers with micro-electrodes, amplify them with \nradio tubes, and record potential differences to a millionth of a volt.\" \nIt is inconceivable that such a network of intricate machinery should be in \nexistence for the sole purpose of carrying on the physical functions incidental to \ngrowth and maintenance of the physical body. Is it not likely that the same \nsystem, which gives billions of brain cells the media for communication one with \nanother, provides, also the means of communication with other intangible forces?\nAfter this book had been written, just before the manuscript went to the \npublisher, there appeared in the New York Times, an editorial showing that at \nleast one great University, and one intelligent investigator in the field of mental \nphenomena, are carrying on an organized research through which conclusions \nhave been reached that parallel many of those described in this and the following \nchapter. The editorial briefly analyzed the work carried on by Dr. Rhine, and his \nassociates at Duke University, viz:—\"What is 'Telepathy'? \n\"A month ago we cited on this page some of the remarkable results \nachieved by Professor Rhine and his associates in Duke University from more \nthan a hundred thousand tests to determine the existence of 'telepathy' and \n'clairvoyance.' These results were summarized in the first two articles in Harpers \nMagazine. In the second which has now appeared, the author, E. H. Wright, \nattempts to summarize what has been learned, or what it seems reasonable to \ninfer, regarding the exact nature of these 'extrasensory' modes of perception.\n\"The actual existence of telepathy and clairvoyance now seems to some \nscientists enormously probable as the result of Rhine's experiments. Various \npercipients were asked to name as many cards in a special pack as they could \nwithout looking at them and without other sensory access to them. About a score \nof men and women were discovered who could regularly name so many of the \ncards correctly that 'there was not one chance in many a million million of their \nhaving done their feats by luck or accident.'\n\"But how did they do them? These powers, assuming that they exist, do \nnot seem to be sensory. There is no known organ for them. The experiments \nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover  How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n  www.think-and-grow-rich-ebook.com  \n204\n  THINK & GROW RICH   \nworked just as well at distances of several hundred miles as they did in the same \nroom. These facts also dispose, in Mr. Wright's opinion, of the attempt to explain \ntelepathy or clairvoyance through any physical theory of radiation. All known \nforms of radiant energy decline inversely as the square of the distance traversed. \nTelepathy and clairvoyance do not. But they do vary through physical causes as \nour other mental powers do. Contrary to widespread opinion, they do not \nimprove when the percipient is asleep or half-asleep, but, on the contrary, when \nhe is most wide-awake and alert. Rhine discovered that a narcotic will invariably \nlower a percipient's score, while a stimulant will always send it higher. The most \nreliable performer apparently cannot make a good score unless he tries to do his \nbest.\n\"One conclusion that Wright draws with some confidence is that telepathy \nand clairvoyance are really one and the same gift. That is, the faculty that 'sees' a \ncard face down on a table seems to be exactly the same one that 'reads' a thought \nresiding only in another mind. There are several grounds for believing this. So \nfar, for example, the two gifts have been found in every person who enjoys either \nof them. In every one so far the two have been of equal vigor, almost exactly. \nScreens, walls, distances, have no effect at all on either. Wright advances from \nthis conclusion to express what he puts forward as no more than the mere \n'hunch' that other extra-sensory experiences, prophetic dreams, premonitions of \ndisaster, and the like, may also prove to be part of the same faculty. The reader is \nnot asked to accept any of these conclusions unless he finds it necessary, but the \nevidence that Rhine has piled up must remain impressive.\"\nIn view of Dr. Rhine's announcement in connection with the conditions \nunder which the mind responds to what he terms extra—sensory modes of \nperception, I now feel privileged to add to his testimony by stating that my \nassociates and I have discovered what we believe to be the ideal conditions \nunder which the mind can be stimulated so that the sixth sense described in the \nnext chapter, can be made to function in a practical way. \nThe conditions to which I refer consist of a close working alliance between \nmyself and two members of my staff. Through experimentation and practice, we \nhave discovered how to stimulate our minds (by applying the principle used in \nconnection with the \"Invisible Counselors\" described in the next chapter) so that \nwe can, by a process of blending our three minds into one, find the solution to a \ngreat variety of personal problems which are submitted by my clients.\nThe procedure is very simple.

It can be assimilated, \nunderstood, and applied ONLY by first mastering the other twelve principles.\nThe SIXTH SENSE is that portion of the subconscious mind which has \nbeen referred to as the Creative Imagination. It has also been referred to as the \n\"receiving set\" through which ideas, plans, and thoughts flash into the mind. The \n\"flashes\" are sometimes called \"hunches\" or \"inspirations.\" \nThe sixth sense defies description! It cannot be described to a person who \nhas not mastered the other principles of this philosophy, because such a person \nhas no knowledge, and no experience with which the sixth sense may be \ncompared. Understanding of the sixth sense comes only by meditation through \nmind development from within. The sixth sense probably is the medium of \ncontact between the finite mind of man and Infinite Intelligence, and for this \nreason, it is a mixture of both the mental and the spiritual. It is believed to be the \npoint at which the mind of man contacts the Universal Mind. \nAfter you have mastered the principles described in this book, you will be \nprepared to accept as truth a statement which may, otherwise, be incredible to \nyou, namely: \nThrough the aid of the sixth sense, you will be warned of impending \ndangers in time to avoid them, and notified of opportunities in time to embrace \nthem. \nThere comes to your aid, and to do your bidding, with the development of \nthe sixth sense, a \"guardian angel\" who will open to you at all times the door to \nthe Temple of Wisdom.\nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover  How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n  www.think-and-grow-rich-ebook.com  \n208\n  THINK & GROW RICH   \nWhether or not this is a statement of truth, you will never know, except by \nfollowing the instructions described in the pages of this book, or some similar \nmethod of procedure. \nThe author is not a believer in, nor an advocate of \"miracles,\" for the \nreason that he has enough knowledge of Nature to understand that Nature never \ndeviates from her established laws. Some of her laws are so incomprehensible that \nthey produce what appear to be \"miracles.\" The sixth sense comes as near to \nbeing a miracle as anything I have ever experienced, and it appears so, only \nbecause I do not understand the method by which this principle is operated. \nThis much the author does know— that there is a power, or a First Cause, \nor an Intelligence, which permeates every atom of matter, and embraces every \nunit of energy perceptible to man— that this Infinite Intelligence converts acorns \ninto oak trees, causes water to flow down hill in response to the law of gravity, \nfollows night with day, and winter with summer, each maintaining its proper \nplace and relationship to the other. This Intelligence may, through the principles \nof this philosophy, be induced to aid in transmuting DESIRES into concrete, or \nmaterial form. The author has this knowledge, because he has experimented with \nit— and has EXPERIENCED IT.\nStep by step, through the preceding chapters, you have been led to this, \nthe last principle. If you have mastered each of the preceding principles, you are \nnow prepared to accept, without being skeptical, the stupendous claims made here. \nIf you have not mastered the other principles, you must do so before you may \ndetermine, definitely, whether or not the claims made in this chapter are fact or \nfiction.\nWhile I was passing through the age of \"hero-worship\" I found myself \ntrying to imitate those whom I most admired. Moreover, I discovered that the \nelement of FAITH, with which I endeavored to imitate my idols, gave me great \ncapacity to do so quite successfully. \nI have never entirely divested myself of this habit of hero-worship, \nalthough I have passed the age commonly given over to such. My experience has \ntaught me that the next best thing to being truly great, is to emulate the great, by \nfeeling and action, as nearly as possible. \nLong before I had ever written a line for publication, or endeavored to \ndeliver a speech in public, I followed the habit of reshaping my own character, \nby trying to imitate the nine men whose lives and life-works had been most \nimpressive to me.

For example, Lincoln developed the habit of always being late, \nthen walking around in solemn parade. When he came, he walked very slowly, \nwith his hands clasped behind him, and once in a while, he would stop as he \npassed, and rest his hand, momentarily, upon my shoulder. He always wore an \nexpression of seriousness upon his face. Rarely did I see him smile. The cares of a \nsundered nation made him grave.\nThat was not true of the others. Burbank and Paine often indulged in witty \nrepartee which seemed, at times, to shock the other members of the cabinet. One \nnight Paine suggested that I prepare a lecture on \"The Age of Reason,\" and \ndeliver it from the pulpit of a church which I formerly attended. Many around \nthe table laughed heartily at the suggestion. Not Napoleon! He drew his mouth \ndown at the corners and groaned so loudly that all turned and looked at him \nwith amazement. To him the church was but a pawn of the State, not to be \nreformed, but to be used, as a convenient inciter to mass activity by the people.\nOn one occasion Burbank was late. When he came, he was excited with \nenthusiasm, and explained that he had been late, because of an experiment he \nwas making, through which he hoped to be able to grow apples on any sort of \ntree. Paine chided him by reminding him that it was an apple which started all \nthe trouble between man and woman. Darwin chuckled heartily as he suggested \nthat Paine should watch out for little serpents, when he went into the forest to \ngather apples, as they had the habit of growing into big snakes. Emerson \nobserved—\" No serpents, no apples,\" and Napoleon remarked, \"No apples, no \nstate!\" \nLincoln developed the habit of always being the last one to leave the table \nafter each meeting. On one occasion, he leaned across the end of the table, his \narms folded, and remained in that position for many minutes. I made no attempt \nto disturb him. Finally, he lifted his head slowly, got up and walked to the door, \nthen turned around, came back, and laid his hand on my shoulder and said, \"My \nboy, you will need much courage if you remain steadfast in carrying out your \npurpose in life. But remember, when difficulties overtake you, the common \npeople have common sense. Adversity will develop it.\" \nOne evening Edison arrived ahead of all the others.

Edison got up, \nand slowly walked around to his own seat. Edison was still living when this \nhappened. It impressed me so greatly that I went to see him, and told him about \nthe experience. He smiled broadly, and said, \"Your dream was more a reality \nthan you may imagine it to have been.\" He added no further explanation to his \nstatement. \nThese meetings became so realistic that I became fearful of their \nconsequences, and discontinued them for several months. The experiences were \nso uncanny, I was afraid if I continued them I would lose sight of the fact that the \nmeetings were purely experiences of my imagination.\nSome six months after I had discontinued the practice I was awakened one \nnight, or thought I was, when I saw Lincoln standing at my bedside.

One of the blessings of \nmaturity is that it sometimes brings one greater courage to be truthful, regardless \nof what those who do not understand, may think or say.\nLest I be misunderstood, I wish here to state most emphatically, that I still \nregard my Cabinet meetings as being purely imaginary, but I feel entitled to \nsuggest that, while the members of my Cabinet may be purely fictional, and the \nmeetings existent only in my own imagination, they have led me into glorious \npaths of adventure, rekindled an appreciation of true greatness, encouraged \ncreative endeavor, and emboldened the expression of honest thought. \nSomewhere in the cell-structure of the brain, is located an organ which \nreceives vibrations of thought ordinarily called \"hunches.\" So far, science has not \ndiscovered where this organ of the sixth sense is located, but this is not \nimportant. The fact remains that human beings do receive accurate knowledge, \nthrough sources other than the physical senses. Such knowledge, generally, is \nreceived when the mind is under the influence of extraordinary stimulation. Any \nemergency which arouses the emotions, and causes the heart to beat more \nrapidly than normal may, and generally does, bring the sixth sense into action. \nAnyone who has experienced a near accident while driving, knows that on such \noccasions, the sixth sense often comes to one's rescue, and aids, by split seconds, \nin avoiding the accident. \nThese facts are mentioned preliminary to a statement of fact which I shall \nnow make, namely, that during my meetings with the \"Invisible Counselors\" I \nfind my mind most receptive to ideas, thoughts, and knowledge which reach me \nthrough the sixth sense.

His vast business and financial operations make it necessary for him \nto understand and use this principle. The late Thomas A. Edison understood and \nused the sixth sense in connection with the development of inventions, especially \nthose involving basic patents, in connection with which he had no human \nexperience and no accumulated knowledge to guide him, as was the case while \nhe was working on the talking machine, and the moving picture machine.\nNearly all great leaders, such as Napoleon, Bismark, Joan of Arc, Christ, \nBuddha, Confucius, and Mohammed, understood, and probably made use of the \nsixth sense almost continuously. The major portion of their greatness consisted of \ntheir knowledge of this principle.\nThe sixth sense is not something that one can take off and put on at will. \nAbility to use this great power comes slowly, through application of the other \nprinciples outlined in this book. Seldom does any individual come into workable \nknowledge of the sixth sense before the age of forty. More often the knowledge is \nnot available until one is well past fifty, and this, for the reason that the spiritual \nforces, with which the sixth sense is so closely related, do not mature and become \nusable except through years of meditation, self-examination, and serious \nthought.\nNo matter who you are, or what may have been your purpose in reading \nthis book, you can profit by it without understanding the principle described in \nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover  How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n  www.think-and-grow-rich-ebook.com  \n215\n  THINK & GROW RICH   \nthis chapter.

Most people are fortunate if they do not suffer \nfrom the entire six. Named in the order of their most common appearance, they \nare:— \nThe fear of POVERTY \n} at the bottom of\nThe fear of CRITICISM \n} most of one's \nThe fear of ILL HEALTH \n} worries \nThe fear of LOSS OF LOVE OF SOMEONE \nThe fear of OLD AGE\nThe fear of DEATH \nAll other fears are of minor importance, they can be grouped under these \nsix headings. \nThe prevalence of these fears, as a curse to the world, runs in cycles. For \nalmost six years, while the depression was on, we floundered in the cycle of \nFEAR OF POVERTY. During the world-war, we were in the cycle of FEAR OF \nDEATH. Just following the war, we were in the cycle of FEAR OF ILL HEALTH, \nas evidenced by the epidemic of disease which spread itself all over the world. \nFears are nothing more than states of mind. One's state of mind is subject to \ncontrol and direction. Physicians, as everyone knows, are less subject to attack by \ndisease than ordinary laymen, for the reason that physicians DO NOT FEAR \nDISEASE. Physicians, without fear or hesitation, have been known to physically \ncontact hundreds of people, daily, who were suffering from such contagious \ndiseases as small-pox, without becoming infected. Their immunity against the \ndisease consisted, largely, if not solely, in their absolute lack of FEAR.\nMan can create nothing which he does not first conceive in the form of an \nimpulse of thought. Following this statement, comes another of still greater \nimportance, namely, MAN'S THOUGHT IMPULSES BEGIN IMMEDIATELY TO \nTRANSLATE THEMSELVES INTO THEIR PHYSICAL EQUIVALENT, \nWHETHER THOSE THOUGHTS ARE VOLUNTARY OR INVOLUNTARY. \nThought impulses which are picked up through the ether, by mere chance \n(thoughts which have been released by other minds) may determine one's \nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover  How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n  www.think-and-grow-rich-ebook.com  \n219\n  THINK & GROW RICH   \nfinancial, business, professional, or social destiny just as surely as do the thought \nimpulses which one creates by intent and design.\nWe are here laying the foundation for the presentation of a fact of great \nimportance to the person who does not understand why some people appear to \nbe \"lucky\" while others of equal or greater ability, training, experience, and brain \ncapacity, seem destined to ride with misfortune. This fact may be explained by \nthe statement that every human being has the ability to completely control his own \nmind, and with this control, obviously, every person may open his mind to the \ntramp thought impulses which are being released by other brains, or close the \ndoors tightly and admit only thought impulses of his own choice. \nNature has endowed man with absolute control over but one thing, and \nthat is THOUGHT. This fact, coupled with the additional fact that everything \nwhich man creates, begins in the form of a thought, leads one very near to the \nprinciple by which FEAR may be mastered.\nIf it is true that ALL THOUGHT HAS A TENDENCY TO CLOTHE \nITSELF IN ITS PHYSICAL EQUIVALENT (and this is true, beyond any \nreasonable room for doubt), it is equally true that thought impulses of fear and \npoverty cannot be translated into terms of courage and financial gain.\nThe people of America began to think of poverty, following the Wall \nStreet crash of 1929. Slowly, but surely that mass thought was crystalized into its \nphysical equivalent, which was known as a \"depression.\" This had to happen, it \nis in conformity with the laws of Nature. \nTHE FEAR OF POVERTY\nThere can be no compromise between POVERTY and RICHES! The two \nroads that lead to poverty and riches travel in opposite directions. If you want \nriches, you must refuse to accept any circumstance that leads toward poverty. \n(The word \"riches\" is here used in its broadest sense, meaning financial, spiritual, \nmental and material estates). The starting point of the path that leads to riches is \nDESIRE. In chapter one, you received full instructions for the proper use of \nDESIRE. In this chapter, on FEAR, you have complete instructions for preparing \nyour mind to make practical use of DESIRE. \nHere, then, is the place to give yourself a challenge which will definitely \ndetermine how much of this philosophy you have absorbed. Here is the point at \nwhich you can turn prophet and foretell, accurately, what the future holds in \nstore for you. If, after reading this chapter, you are willing to accept poverty, you \nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover  How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n  www.think-and-grow-rich-ebook.com  \n220\n  THINK & GROW RICH   \nmay as well make up your mind to receive poverty. This is one decision you \ncannot avoid.\nIf you demand riches, determine what form, and how much will be \nrequired to satisfy you. You know the road that leads to riches. You have been \ngiven a road map which, if followed, will keep you on that road. If you neglect to \nmake the start, or stop before you arrive, no one will be to blame, but YOU. This \nresponsibility is yours. No alibi will save you from accepting the responsibility if \nyou now fail or refuse to demand riches of Life, because the acceptance calls for \nbut one thing— incidentally, the only thing you can control—and that is a STATE \nOF MIND. A state of mind is something that one assumes. It cannot be \npurchased, it must be created.\nFear of poverty is a state of mind, nothing else! But it is sufficient to \ndestroy one's chances of achievement in any undertaking, a truth which became \npainfully evident during the depression. \nThis fear paralyzes the faculty of reason, destroys the faculty of \nimagination, kills off self-reliance, undermines enthusiasm, discourages \ninitiative, leads to uncertainty of purpose, encourages procrastination, wipes out \nenthusiasm and makes self-control an impossibility. It takes the charm from one's \npersonality, destroys the possibility of accurate thinking, diverts concentration of \neffort, it masters persistence, turns the will-power into nothingness, destroys \nambition, beclouds the memory and invites failure in every conceivable form; it \nkills love and assassinates the finer emotions of the heart, discourages friendship \nand invites disaster in a hundred forms, leads to sleeplessness, misery and \nunhappiness— and all this despite the obvious truth that we live in a world of \nover-abundance of everything the heart could desire, with nothing standing \nbetween us and our desires, excepting lack of a definite purpose. \nThe Fear of Poverty is, without doubt, the most destructive of the six basic \nfears. It has been placed at the head of the list, because it is the most difficult to \nmaster. Considerable courage is required to state the truth about the origin of \nthis fear, and still greater courage to accept the truth after it has been stated. The \nfear of poverty grew out of man's inherited tendency to PREY UPON HIS \nFELLOW MAN ECONOMICALLY. Nearly all animals lower than man are \nmotivated by instinct, but their capacity to \"think\" is limited, therefore, they prey \nupon one another physically. Man, with his superior sense of intuition, with the \ncapacity to think and to reason, does not eat his fellowman bodily, he gets more \nsatisfaction out of \"eating\" him FINANCIALLY. Man is so avaricious that every \nconceivable law has been passed to safeguard him from his fellowman.\nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover  How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n  www.think-and-grow-rich-ebook.com  \n221\n  THINK & GROW RICH   \nOf all the ages of the world, of which we know anything, the age in which \nwe live seems to be one that is outstanding because of man's money-madness. A \nman is considered less than the dust of the earth, unless he can display a fat bank \naccount; but if he has money— NEVER MIND HOW HE ACQUIRED IT— he is a \n\"king\" or a \"big shot\"; he is above the law, he rules in politics, he dominates in \nbusiness, and the whole world about him bows in respect when he passes.\nNothing brings man so much suffering and humility as POVERTY! Only \nthose who have experienced poverty understand the full meaning of this.\nIt is no wonder that man fears poverty. Through a long line of inherited \nexperiences man has learned, for sure, that some men cannot be trusted, where \nmatters of money and earthly possessions are concerned. This is a rather stinging \nindictment, the worst part of it being that it is TRUE.\nThe majority of marriages are motivated by the wealth possessed by one, \nor both of the contracting parties. It is no wonder, therefore, that the divorce \ncourts are busy. \nSo eager is man to possess wealth that he will acquire it in whatever \nmanner he can— through legal methods if possible— through other methods if \nnecessary or expedient. \nSelf-analysis may disclose weaknesses which one does not like to \nacknowledge. This form of examination is essential to all who demand of Life \nmore than mediocrity and poverty. Remember, as you check yourself point by \npoint, that you are both the court and the jury, the prosecuting attorney and the \nattorney for the defense, and that you are the plaintiff and the defendant, also, \nthat you are on trial. Face the facts squarely. Ask yourself definite questions and \ndemand direct replies. When the examination is over, you will know more about \nyourself.

Get it, no matter at what cost \neven though it may temporarily embarrass you! \nThe majority of people, if asked what they fear most, would reply, \"I fear \nnothing.\" The reply would be inaccurate, because few people realize that they are \nbound, handicapped, whipped spiritually and physically through some form of \nfear. So subtle and deeply seated is the emotion of fear that one may go through \nlife burdened with it, never recognizing its presence. Only a courageous analysis \nwill disclose the presence of this universal enemy. When you begin such an \nanalysis, search deeply into your character.

The habit of permitting others to do one's thinking. Staying \"on \nthe fence.\" \nDOUBT. Generally expressed through alibis and excuses designed to cover up, \nexplain away, or apologize for one's failures, sometimes expressed in the form of \nenvy of those who are successful, or by criticising them.\nWORRY. Usually expressed by finding fault with others, a tendency to spend \nbeyond one's income, neglect of personal appearance, scowling and frowning; \nintemperance in the use of alcoholic drink, sometimes through the use of \nnarcotics; nervousness, lack of poise, self-consciousness and lack of self-reliance. \nOVER-CAUTION. The habit of looking for the negative side of every \ncircumstance, thinking and talking of possible failure instead of concentrating \nupon the means of succeeding. Knowing all the roads to disaster, but never \nsearching for the plans to avoid failure. Waiting for \"the right time\" to begin \nputting ideas and plans into action, until the waiting becomes a permanent habit. \nRemembering those who have failed, and forgetting those who have succeeded. \nSeeing the hole in the doughnut, but overlooking the doughnut.

Why measure \nriches in dollars, alone?\" Some will believe, and rightly so, that there are other \nforms of riches more desirable than money. Yes, there are riches which cannot be \nmeasured in terms of dollars, but there are millions of people who will say, \"Give \nme all the money I need, and I will find everything else I want.\" \nThe major reason why I wrote this book on how to get money is the fact \nthat the world has but lately passed through an experience that left millions of \nmen and women paralyzed with the FEAR OF POVERTY. What this sort of fear \ndoes to one was well described by Westbrook Pegler, in the New York World-\nTelegram, viz: \n\"Money is only clam shells or metal discs or scraps of paper, and there are \ntreasures of the heart and soul which money cannot buy, but most people, being \nbroke, are unable to keep this in mind and sustain their spirits. When a man is \ndown and out and on the street, unable to get any job at all, something happens \nto his spirit which can be observed in the droop of his shoulders, the set of his \nhat, his walk and his gaze. He cannot escape a feeling of inferiority among \npeople with regular employment, even though he knows they are definitely not \nhis equals in character, intelligence or ability.\n\"These people—even his friends—feel, on the other hand, a sense of \nsuperiority and regard him, perhaps unconsciously, as a casualty. He may \nborrow for a time, but not enough to carry on in his accustomed way, and he \ncannot continue to borrow very long. But borrowing in itself, when a man is \nborrowing merely to live, is a depressing experience, and the money lacks the \npower of earned money to revive his spirits. Of course, none of this applies to \nbums or habitual ne'er-do-wells, but only to men of normal ambitions and self-\nrespect. \n\"WOMEN CONCEAL DESPAIR.\nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover  How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n  www.think-and-grow-rich-ebook.com  \n224\n  THINK & GROW RICH   \n\"Women in the same predicament must be different. We somehow do not \nthink of women at all in considering the down-and-outers. They are scarce in the \nbreadlines, they rarely are seen begging on the streets, and they are not \nrecognizable in crowds by the same plain signs which identify busted men. Of \ncourse, I do not mean the shuffling hags of the city streets who are the opposite \nnumber of the confirmed male bums. I mean reasonably young, decent and \nintelligent women. There must be many of them, but their despair is not \napparent. Maybe they kill themselves.\n\"When a man is down and out he has time on his hands for brooding. He \nmay travel miles to see a man about a job and discover that the job is filled or \nthat it is one of those jobs with no base pay but only a commission on the sale of \nsome useless knick-knack which nobody would buy, except out of pity. Turning \nthat down, he finds himself back on the street with nowhere to go but just \nanywhere. So he walks and walks. He gazes into store windows at luxuries \nwhich are not for him, and feels inferior and gives way to people who stop to \nlook with an active interest. He wanders into the railroad station or puts himself \ndown in the library to ease his legs and soak up a little heat, but that isn't looking \nfor a job, so he gets going again. He may not know it, but his aimlessness would \ngive him away even if the very lines of his figure did not. He may be well \ndressed in the clothes left over from the days when he had a steady job, but the \nclothes cannot disguise the droop. \n\"MONEY MAKES DIFFERENCE.\n\"He sees thousands of other people, bookkeepers or clerks or chemists or \nwagon hands, busy at their work and envies them from the bottom of his soul. \nThey have their independence, their self-respect and manhood, and he simply \ncannot convince himself that he is a good man, too, though he argue it out and \narrive at a favorable verdict hour after hour.\n\"It is just money which makes this difference in him.

Some believe that this \nfear made its appearance about the time that politics became a \"profession.\" \nOthers believe it can be traced to the age when women first began to concern \nthemselves with \"styles\" in wearing apparel.\nThis author, being neither a humorist nor a prophet, is inclined to attribute \nthe basic fear of criticism to that part of man's inherited nature which prompts \nhim not only to take away his fellowman's goods and wares, but to justify his \naction by CRITICISM of his fellowman's character. It is a well known fact that a \nthief will criticise the man from whom he steals—that politicians seek office, not \nby displaying their own virtues and qualifications, but by attempting to besmirch \ntheir opponents. \nThe fear of criticism takes on many forms, the majority of which are petty \nand trivial. Bald-headed men, for example, are bald for no other reason than their \nfear of criticism. Heads become bald because of the tight fitting bands of hats \nwhich cut off the circulation from the roots of the hair. Men wear hats, not \nbecause they actually need them, but mainly because \"everyone is doing it.\" The \nindividual falls into line and does likewise, lest some other individual CRITICISE \nhim. Women seldom have bald heads, or even thin hair, because they wear hats \nwhich fit their heads loosely, the only purpose of the hats being adornment.\nBut, it must not be supposed that women are free from the fear of \ncriticism. If any woman claims to be superior to man with reference to this fear, \nask her to walk down the street wearing a hat of the vintage of 1890.\nThe astute manufacturers of clothing have not been slow to capitalize this \nbasic fear of criticism, with which all mankind has been cursed. Every season the \nstyles in many articles of wearing apparel change. Who establishes the styles? \nCertainly not the purchaser of clothing, but the manufacturer. Why does he \nchange the styles so often? The answer is obvious. He changes the styles so he \ncan sell more clothes. \nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover  How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n  www.think-and-grow-rich-ebook.com  \n226\n  THINK & GROW RICH   \nFor the same reason the manufacturers of automobiles (with a few rare \nand very sensible exceptions) change styles of models every season. No man \nwants to drive an automobile which is not of the latest style, although the older \nmodel may actually be the better car. \nWe have been describing the manner in which people behave under the \ninfluence of fear of criticism as applied to the small and petty things of life. Let us \nnow examine human behavior when this fear affects people in connection with \nthe more important events of human relationship. Take for example practically \nany person who has reached the age of \"mental maturity\" (from 35 to 40 years of \nage, as a general average), and if you could read the secret thoughts of his mind, \nyou would find a very decided disbelief in most of the fables taught by the \nmajority of the dogmatists and theologians a few decades back. \nNot often, however, will you find a person who has the courage to openly \nstate his belief on this subject. Most people will, if pressed far enough, tell a lie \nrather than admit that they do not believe the stories associated with that form of \nreligion which held people in bondage prior to the age of scientific discovery and \neducation. \nWhy does the average person, even in this day of enlightenment, shy \naway from denying his belief in the fables which were the basis of most of the \nreligions a few decades ago? The answer is, \"because of the fear of criticism.\" \nMen and women have been burned at the stake for daring to express disbelief in \nghosts. It is no wonder we have inherited a consciousness which makes us fear \ncriticism. The time was, and not so far in the past, when criticism carried severe \npunishments—it still does in some countries.\nThe fear of criticism robs man of his initiative, destroys his power of \nimagination, limits his individuality, takes away his self-reliance, and does him \ndamage in a hundred other ways. Parents often do their children irreparable \ninjury by criticising them. The mother of one of my boyhood chums used to \npunish him with a switch almost daily, always completing the job with the \nstatement, \"You'll land in the penitentiary before you are twenty.\" He was sent to \na Reformatory at the age of seventeen. \nCriticism is the one form of service, of which everyone has too much. \nEveryone has a stock of it which is handed out, gratis, whether called for or not. \nOne's nearest relatives often are the worst offenders. It should be recognized as a \ncrime (in reality it is a crime of the worst nature), for any parent to build \ninferiority complexes in the mind of a child, through unnecessary criticism. \nEmployers who understand human nature, get the best there is in men, not by \nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover  How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n  www.think-and-grow-rich-ebook.com  \n227\n  THINK & GROW RICH   \ncriticism, but by constructive suggestion. Parents may accomplish the same \nresults with their children. Criticism will plant FEAR in the human heart, or \nresentment, but it will not build love or affection.\nSYMPTOMS OF THE FEAR OF CRITICISM \nThis fear is almost as universal as the fear of poverty, and its effects are \njust as fatal to personal achievement, mainly because this fear destroys initiative, \nand discourages the use of imagination. The major symptoms of the fear are: \nSELF-CONSCIOUSNESS. Generally expressed through \nnervousness, timidity in conversation and in meeting strangers, \nawkward movement of the hands and limbs, shifting of the eyes. \nLACK OF POISE. Expressed through lack of voice control, \nnervousness in the presence of others, poor posture of body, poor \nmemory. \nPERSONALITY. Lacking in firmness of decision, personal \ncharm, and ability to express opinions definitely. The habit of side-\nstepping issues instead of meeting them squarely. Agreeing with \nothers without careful examination of their opinions. \nINFERIORITY COMPLEX. The habit of expressing self-\napproval by word of mouth and by actions, as a means of covering \nup a feeling of inferiority. Using \"big words\" to impress others, \n(often without knowing the real meaning of the words). Imitating \nothers in dress, speech and manners. Boasting of imaginary \nachievements. This sometimes gives a surface appearance of a \nfeeling of superiority.\nEXTRAVAGANCE. The habit of trying to \"keep up with the \nJoneses,\" spending beyond one's income. \nLACK OF INITIATIVE. Failure to embrace opportunities for \nself-advancement, fear to express opinions, lack of confidence in \none's own ideas, giving evasive answers to questions asked by \nsuperiors, hesitancy of manner and speech, deceit in both words \nand deeds. \nLACK OF AMBITION. Mental and physical laziness, lack of \nself-assertion, slowness in reaching decisions, easily influenced by \nothers, the habit of criticising others behind their backs and \nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover  How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n  www.think-and-grow-rich-ebook.com  \n228\n  THINK & GROW RICH   \nflattering them to their faces, the habit of accepting defeat without \nprotest, quitting an undertaking when opposed by others, \nsuspicious of other people without cause, lacking in tactfulness of \nmanner and speech, unwillingness to accept the blame for mistakes. \nTHE FEAR OF ILL HEALTH\nThis fear may be traced to both physical and social heredity. It is closely \nassociated, as to its origin, with the causes of fear of Old Age and the fear of \nDeath, because it leads one closely to the border of \"terrible worlds\" of which \nman knows not, but concerning which he has been taught some discomforting \nstories. The opinion is somewhat general, also, that certain unethical people \nengaged in the business of \"selling health\" have had not a little to do with \nkeeping alive the fear of ill health. \nIn the main, man fears ill health because of the terrible pictures which \nhave been planted in his mind of what may happen if death should overtake \nhim. He also fears it because of the economic toll which it may claim. \nA reputable physician estimated that 75% of all people who visit \nphysicians for professional service are suffering with hypochondria (imaginary \nillness). It has been shown most convincingly that the fear of disease, even where \nthere is not the slightest cause for fear, often produces the physical symptoms of \nthe disease feared.\nPowerful and mighty is the human mind! It builds or it destroys. \nPlaying upon this common weakness of fear of ill health, dispensers of \npatent medicines have reaped fortunes. This form of imposition upon credulous \nhumanity became so prevalent some twenty years ago that Colliers' Weekly \nMagazine conducted a bitter campaign against some of the worst offenders in the \npatent medicine business.\nDuring the \"flu\" epidemic which broke out during the world war, the \nmayor of New York City took drastic steps to check the damage which people \nwere doing themselves through their inherent fear of ill health. He called in the \nnewspaper men and said to them, \"Gentlemen, I feel it necessary to ask you not \nto publish any scare headlines concerning the 'flu' epidemic. Unless you cooperate \nwith me, we will have a situation which we cannot control.\" The newspapers quit \npublishing stories about the \"flu,\" and within one month the epidemic had been \nsuccessfully checked. \nThrough a series of experiments conducted some years ago, it was proved \nthat people may be made ill by suggestion. We conducted this experiment by \nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover  How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n  www.think-and-grow-rich-ebook.com  \n229\n  THINK & GROW RICH   \ncausing three acquaintances to visit the \"victims,\" each of whom asked the \nquestion, \"What ails you? You look terribly ill.\" The first questioner usually \nprovoked a grin, and a nonchalant \"Oh, nothing, I'm alright,\" from the victim. \nThe second questioner usually was answered with the statement, \"I don't know \nexactly, but I do feel badly.\" The third questioner was usually met with the frank \nadmission that the victim was actually feeling ill.\nTry this on an acquaintance if you doubt that it will make him \nuncomfortable, but do not carry the experiment too far. There is a certain \nreligious sect whose members take vengeance upon their enemies by the \n\"hexing\" method. They call it \"placing a spell\" on the victim. \nThere is overwhelming evidence that disease sometimes begins in the \nform of negative thought impulse. Such an impulse may be passed from one \nmind to another, by suggestion, or created by an individual in his own mind. \nA man who was blessed with more wisdom than this incident might \nindicate, once said \"When anyone asks me how I feel, I always want to answer by \nknocking him down.\" \nDoctors send patients into new climates for their health, because a change \nof \"mental attitude\" is necessary. The seed of fear of ill health lives in every \nhuman mind. Worry, fear, discouragement, disappointment in love and business \naffairs, cause this seed to germinate and grow. The recent business depression \nkept the doctors on the run, because every form of negative thinking may cause \nill health.\nDisappointments in business and in love stand at the head of the list of \ncauses of fear of ill health. A young man suffered a disappointment in love which \nsent him to a hospital. For months he hovered between life and death. A \nspecialist in suggestive therapeutics was called in. The specialist changed nurses, \nplacing him in charge of a very charming young woman who began (by pre-\narrangement with the doctor) to make love to him the first day of her arrival on \nthe job. Within three weeks the patient was discharged from the hospital, still \nsuffering, but with an entirely different malady. HE WAS IN LOVE AGAIN. The \nremedy was a hoax, but the patient and the nurse were later married. Both are in \ngood health at the time of this writing. \nSYMPTOMS OF THE FEAR OF ILL HEALTH\nThe symptoms of this almost universal fear are: \nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover  How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n  www.think-and-grow-rich-ebook.com  \n230\n  THINK & GROW RICH   \nAUTO-SUGGESTION.

The habit of trying all \"fads\" and \"isms\" \nrecommended by others as having therapeutic value. Talking to \nothers of operations, accidents and other forms of illness. \nExperimenting with diets, physical exercises, reducing systems, \nwithout professional guidance. Trying home remedies, patent \nmedicines and \"quack\" remedies. \nHYPOCHONDRIA. The habit of talking of illness, \nconcentrating the mind upon disease, and expecting its appearance \nuntil a nervous break occurs. Nothing that comes in bottles can cure \nthis condition. It is brought on by negative thinking and nothing \nbut positive thought can affect a cure. Hypochondria, (a medical \nterm for imaginary disease) is said to do as much damage on \noccasion, as the disease one fears might do. Most so-called cases of \n\"nerves\" come from imaginary illness. \nEXERCISE. Fear of ill health often interferes with proper \nphysical exercise, and results in over-weight, by causing one to \navoid outdoor life. \nSUSCEPTIBILITY. Fear of ill health breaks down Nature's \nbody resistance, and creates a favorable condition for any form of \ndisease one may contact.\nThe fear of ill health often is related to the fear of Poverty, \nespecially in the case of the hypochondriac, who constantly worries \nabout the possibility of having to pay doctor's bills, hospital bills, \netc. This type of person spends much time preparing for sickness, \ntalking about death, saving money for cemetery lots, and burial \nexpenses, etc. \nSELF-CODDLING.

This fear is the most painful of all \nthe six basic fears. It probably plays more havoc with the body and mind than \nany of the other basic fears, as it often leads to permanent insanity. \nThe fear of the loss of love probably dates back to the stone age, when \nmen stole women by brute force. They continue to steal females, but their \ntechnique has changed. Instead of force, they now use persuasion, the promise of \npretty clothes, motor cars, and other \"bait\" much more effective than physical \nforce. Man's habits are the same as they were at the dawn of civilization, but he \nexpresses them differently.\nCareful analysis has shown that women are more susceptible to this fear \nthan men. This fact is easily explained. Women have learned, from experience, \nthat men are polygamous by nature, that they are not to be trusted in the hands \nof rivals. \nSYMPTOMS OF THE FEAR OF LOSS OF LOVE\nThe distinguishing symptoms of this fear are:— \nJEALOUSY. The habit of being suspicious of friends and \nloved ones without any reasonable evidence of sufficient grounds. \n(Jealousy is a form of dementia praecox which sometimes becomes \nviolent without the slightest cause). The habit of accusing wife or \nhusband of infidelity without grounds. General suspicion of \neveryone, absolute faith in no one. \nFAULT FINDING. The habit of finding fault with friends, \nrelatives, business associates and loved ones upon the slightest \nprovocation, or without any cause whatsoever.\nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover  How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n  www.think-and-grow-rich-ebook.com  \n232\n  THINK & GROW RICH   \nGAMBLING.

The habit of spending \nbeyond one's means, or incurring debts, to provide gifts for loved \nones, with the object of making a favorable showing. Insomnia, \nnervousness, lack of persistence, weakness of will, lack of self-\ncontrol, lack of self-reliance, bad temper.\nTHE FEAR OF OLD AGE\nIn the main, this fear grows out of two sources. First, the thought that old \nage may bring with it POVERTY. Secondly, and by far the most common source \nof origin, from false and cruel teachings of the past which have been too well \nmixed with \"fire and brimstone,\" and other bogies cunningly designed to enslave \nman through fear.\nIn the basic fear of old age, man has two very sound reasons for his \napprehension— one growing out of his distrust of his fellowman, who may seize \nwhatever worldly goods he may possess, and the other arising from the terrible \npictures of the world beyond, which were planted in his mind, through social \nheredity before he came into full possession of his mind. \nThe possibility of ill health, which is more common as people grow older, \nis also a contributing cause of this common fear of old age. Eroticism also enters \ninto the cause of the fear of old age, as no man cherishes the thought of \ndiminishing sex attraction. \nThe most common cause of fear of old age is associated with the \npossibility of poverty. \"Poorhouse\" is not a pretty word. It throws a chill into the \nmind of every person who faces the possibility of having to spend his declining \nyears on a poor farm. \nAnother contributing cause of the fear of old age, is the possibility of loss \nof freedom and independence, as old age may bring with it the loss of both \nphysical and economic freedom. \nSYMPTOMS OF THE FEAR OF OLD AGE\nThe commonest symptoms of this fear are: \nThe tendency to slow down and develop an inferiority \ncomplex at the age of mental maturity, around the age of forty, \nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover  How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n  www.think-and-grow-rich-ebook.com  \n233\n  THINK & GROW RICH   \nfalsely believing one's self to be \"slipping\" because of age. (The \ntruth is that man's most useful years, mentally and spiritually, are \nthose between forty and sixty). \nThe habit of speaking apologetically of one's self as \"being \nold\" merely because one has reached the age of forty, or fifty, \ninstead of reversing the rule and expressing gratitude for having \nreached the age of wisdom and understanding. \nThe habit of killing off initiative, imagination, and self-\nreliance by falsely believing one's self too old to exercise these \nqualities. The habit of the man or woman of forty dressing with the \naim of trying to appear much younger, and affecting mannerisms \nof youth; thereby inspiring ridicule by both friends and strangers. \nTHE FEAR OF DEATH\nTo some this is the cruelest of all the basic fears. The reason is obvious. \nThe terrible pangs of fear associated with the thought of death, in the majority of \ncases, may be charged directly to religious fanaticism. So-called \"heathen\" are \nless afraid of death than the more \"civilized.\" For hundreds of millions of years \nman has been asking the still unanswered questions, \"whence\" and \"whither.\" \nWhere did I come from, and where am I going? \nDuring the darker ages of the past, the more cunning and crafty were not \nslow to offer the answer to these questions, FOR A PRICE. Witness, now, the \nmajor source of origin of the FEAR OF DEATH.\n\"Come into my tent, embrace my faith, accept my dogmas, and I will give \nyou a ticket that will admit you straightaway into heaven when you die,\" cries a \nleader of sectarianism. \"Remain out of my tent,\" says the same leader, \"and may \nthe devil take you and burn you throughout eternity.\" \nETERNITY is a long time. FIRE is a terrible thing. The thought of eternal \npunishment, with fire, not only causes man to fear death, it often causes him to \nlose his reason. It destroys interest in life and makes happiness impossible.\nDuring my research, I reviewed a book entitled \"A Catalogue of the \nGods,\" in which were listed the 30,000 gods which man has worshiped. Think of \nit! Thirty thousand of them, represented by everything from a crawfish to a man. \nIt is little wonder that men have become frightened at the approach of death. \nWhile the religious leader may not be able to provide safe conduct into \nheaven, nor, by lack of such provision, allow the unfortunate to descend into \nhell, the possibility of the latter seems so terrible that the very thought of it lays \nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover  How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n  www.think-and-grow-rich-ebook.com  \n234\n  THINK & GROW RICH   \nhold of the imagination in such a realistic way that it paralyzes reason, and sets \nup the fear of death.\nIn truth, NO MAN KNOWS, and no man has ever known, what heaven or \nhell is like, nor does any man know if either place actually exists. This very lack \nof positive knowledge opens the door of the human mind to the charlatan so he \nmay enter and control that mind with his stock of legerdemain and various \nbrands of pious fraud and trickery. \nThe fear of DEATH is not as common now as it was during the age when \nthere were no great colleges and universities. Men of science have turned the \nspotlight of truth upon the world, and this truth is rapidly freeing men and \nwomen from this terrible fear of DEATH. The young men and young women \nwho attend the colleges and universities are not easily impressed by \"fire\" and \n\"brimstone.\" Through the aid of biology, astronomy, geology, and other related \nsciences, the fears of the dark ages which gripped the minds of men and \ndestroyed their reason have been dispelled.\nInsane asylums are filled with men and women who have gone mad, \nbecause of the FEAR OF DEATH. \nThis fear is useless. Death will come, no matter what anyone may think \nabout it. Accept it as a necessity, and pass the thought out of your mind. It must \nbe a, necessity, or it would not come to all. Perhaps it is not as bad as it has been \npictured.\nThe entire world is made up of only two things, ENERGY and MATTER. \nIn elementary physics we learn that neither matter nor energy (the only two \nrealities known to man) can be created nor destroyed. Both matter and energy \ncan be transformed, but neither can be destroyed. \nLife is energy, if it is anything. If neither energy nor matter can be \ndestroyed, of course life cannot be destroyed. Life, like other forms of energy, \nmay be passed through various processes of transition, or change, but it cannot \nbe destroyed. Death is mere transition.\nIf death is not mere change, or transition, then nothing comes after death \nexcept a long, eternal, peaceful sleep, and sleep is nothing to be feared. Thus you \nmay wipe out, forever, the fear of Death. \nSYMPTOMS OF THE FEAR OF DEATH\nThe general symptoms of this fear are:— \nThe habit of THINKING about dying instead of making the \nmost of LIFE, due, generally, to lack of purpose, or lack of a suitable \nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover  How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n  www.think-and-grow-rich-ebook.com  \n235\n  THINK & GROW RICH   \noccupation. This fear is more prevalent among the aged, but \nsometimes the more youthful are victims of it. The greatest of all \nremedies for the fear of death is a BURNING DESIRE FOR \nACHIEVEMENT, backed by useful service to others. A busy person \nseldom has time to think about dying. He finds life too thrilling to \nworry about death. Sometimes the fear of death is closely \nassociated with the Fear of Poverty, where one's death would leave \nloved ones poverty-stricken. In other cases, the fear of death is \ncaused by illness and the consequent breaking down of physical \nbody resistance. The commonest causes of the fear of death are: ill-\nhealth, poverty, lack of appropriate occupation, disappointment \nover love, insanity, religious fanaticism. \nOLD MAN WORRY\nWorry is a state of mind based upon fear. It works slowly, but \npersistently. It is insiduous and subtle. Step by step it \"digs itself in\" until it \nparalyzes one's reasoning faculty, destroys self-confidence and initiative. Worry \nis a form of sustained fear caused by indecision therefore it is a state of mind \nwhich can be controlled.\nAn unsettled mind is helpless. Indecision makes an unsettled mind. Most \nindividuals lack the willpower to reach decisions promptly, and to stand by them \nafter they have been made, even during normal business conditions. During \nperiods of economic unrest (such as the world recently experienced), the \nindividual is handicapped, not alone by his inherent nature to be slow at \nreaching decisions, but he is influenced by the indecision of others around him \nwho have created a state of \"mass indecision.\"\nDuring the depression the whole atmosphere, all over the world, was \nfilled with \"Fearenza\" and \"Worryitis,\" the two mental disease germs which \nbegan to spread themselves after the Wall Street frenzy in 1929. There is only one \nknown antidote for these germs; it is the habit of prompt and firm DECISION. \nMoreover, it is an antidote which every individual must apply for himself. \nWe do not worry over conditions, once we have reached a decision to \nfollow a definite line of action.\nI once interviewed a man who was to be electrocuted two hours later.

His calmness prompted me to ask him how it felt to know that he was \ngoing into eternity in a short while. With a smile of confidence on his face, he \nsaid, \"It feels fine. Just think, brother, my troubles will soon be over. I have had \nnothing but trouble all my life. It has been a hardship to get food and clothing. \nSoon I will not need these things. I have felt fine ever since I learned FOR \nCERTAIN that I must die. I made up my mind then, to accept my fate in good \nspirit.\" \nAs he spoke he devoured a dinner of proportions sufficient for three men, \neating every mouthful of the food brought to him, and apparently enjoying it as \nmuch as if no disaster awaited him. DECISION gave this man resignation to his \nfate! Decision can also prevent one's acceptance of undesired circumstances. \nThe six basic fears become translated into a state of worry, through \nindecision. Relieve yourself, forever of the fear of death, by reaching a decision to \naccept death as an inescapable event. Whip the fear of poverty by reaching a \ndecision to get along with whatever wealth you can accumulate WITHOUT \nWORRY. Put your foot upon the neck of the fear of criticism by reaching a \ndecision NOT TO WORRY about what other people think, do, or say. Eliminate \nthe fear of old age by reaching a decision to accept it, not as a handicap, but as a \ngreat blessing which carries with it wisdom, self-control, and understanding not \nknown to youth. \nAcquit yourself of the fear of ill health by the decision to forget symptoms. \nMaster the fear of loss of love by reaching a decision to get along without love, if \nthat is necessary. \nKill the habit of worry, in all its forms, by reaching a general, blanket \ndecision that nothing which life has to offer is worth the price of worry. With this \ndecision will come poise, peace of mind, and calmness of thought which will \nbring happiness. \nA man whose mind is filled with fear not only destroys his own chances of \nintelligent action, but, he transmits these destructive vibrations to the minds of \nall who come into contact with him, and destroys, also their chances.\nEven a dog or a horse knows when its master lacks courage; moreover, a \ndog or a horse will pick up the vibrations of fear thrown off by its master, and \nbehave accordingly. Lower down the line of intelligence in the animal kingdom, \none finds this same capacity to pick up the vibrations of fear. A honey-bee \nimmediately senses fear in the mind of a person—for reasons unknown, a bee \nwill sting the person whose mind is releasing vibrations of fear, much more \nreadily than it will molest the person whose mind registers no fear. \nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover  How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n  www.think-and-grow-rich-ebook.com  \n237\n  THINK & GROW RICH   \nThe vibrations of fear pass from one mind to another just as quickly and as \nsurely as the sound of the human voice passes from the broadcasting station to \nthe receiving set of a radio—and BY THE SELF-SAME MEDIUM. \nMental telepathy is a reality. Thoughts pass from one mind to another, \nvoluntarily, whether or not this fact is recognized by either the person releasing \nthe thoughts, or the persons who pick up those thoughts. \nThe person who gives expression, by word of mouth, to negative or \ndestructive thoughts is practically certain to experience the results of those words \nin the form of a destructive \"kick-back.\" The release of destructive thought \nimpulses, alone, without the aid of words, produces also a \"kickback\" in more \nways than one. First of all, and perhaps most important to be remembered, the \nperson who releases thoughts of a destructive nature, must suffer damage \nthrough the breaking down of the faculty of creative imagination. Secondly, the \npresence in the mind of any destructive emotion develops a negative personality \nwhich repels people, and often converts them into antagonists. The third source \nof damage to the person who entertains or releases negative thoughts, lies in this \nsignificant fact— these thought-impulses are not only damaging to others, but \nthey IMBED THEMSELVES IN THE SUBCONSCIOUS MIND OF THE PERSON \nRELEASING THEM, and there become a part of his character.\nOne is never through with a thought, merely by releasing it. When a \nthought is released, it spreads in every direction, through the medium of the \nether, but it also plants itself permanently in the subconscious mind of the person \nreleasing it. \nYour business in life is, presumably to achieve success. To be successful, \nyou must find peace of mind, acquire the material needs of life, and above all, \nattain HAPPINESS. All of these evidences of success begin in the form of thought \nimpulses. \nYou may control your own mind, you have the power to feed it whatever \nthought impulses you choose. With this privilege goes also the responsibility of \nusing it constructively. You are the master of your own earthly destiny just as \nsurely as you have the power to control your own thoughts. You may influence, \ndirect, and eventually control your own environment, making your life what you \nwant it to be— or, you may neglect to exercise the privilege which is yours, to \nmake your life to order, thus casting yourself upon the broad sea of \n\"Circumstance\" where you will be tossed hither and yon, like a chip on the waves \nof the ocean.\nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover  How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n  www.think-and-grow-rich-ebook.com  \n238\n  THINK & GROW RICH   \nTHE DEVIL'S WORKSHOP\nTHE SEVENTH BASIC EVIL\nIn addition to the Six Basic Fears, there is another evil by which people \nsuffer.

Moreover, its weapon \nis intangible, because it consists of merely— a STATE OF MIND. This evil is also \ndangerous because it strikes in as many different forms as there are human \nexperiences. Sometimes it enters the mind through the well-meant words of one's \nown relatives. At other times, it bores from within, through one's own mental \nattitude. Always it is as deadly as poison, even though it may not kill as quickly.\nHow TO PROTECT YOURSELF AGAINST NEGATIVE \nINFLUENCES\nTo protect yourself against negative influences, whether of your own \nmaking, or the result of the activities of negative people around you, recognize \nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover  How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n  www.think-and-grow-rich-ebook.com  \n239\n  THINK & GROW RICH   \nthat you have a WILL-POWER, and put it into constant use, until it builds a wall \nof immunity against negative influences in your own mind. \nRecognize the fact that you, and every other human being, are, by nature, \nlazy, indifferent, and susceptible to all suggestions which harmonize with your \nweaknesses. \nRecognize that you are, by nature, susceptible to all the six basic fears, and \nset up. habits for the purpose of counteracting all these fears.\nRecognize that negative influences often work on you through your \nsubconscious mind, therefore they are difficult to detect, and keep your mind \nclosed against all people who depress or discourage you in any way. \nClean out your medicine chest, throw away all pill bottles, and stop \npandering to colds, aches, pains and imaginary illness.\nDeliberately seek the company of people who influence you to THINK \nAND ACT FOR YOURSELF.\nDo not EXPECT troubles as they have a tendency not to dissappoint.\nWithout doubt, the most common weakness of all human beings is the habit of \nleaving their minds open to the negative influence of other people. This weakness is all \nthe more damaging, because most people do not recognize that they are cursed \nby it, and many who acknowledge it, neglect or refuse to correct the evil until it \nbecomes an uncontrollable part of their daily habits.\nTo aid those who wish to see themselves as they really are, the following \nlist of questions has been prepared.

Study the questions carefully, come back to \nthem once each week for several months, and be astounded at the amount of \nadditional knowledge of great value to yourself, you will have gained by the \nsimple method of answering the questions truthfully. If you are not certain \nconcerning the answers to some of the questions, seek the counsel of those who \nknow you well, especially those who have no motive in flattering you, and see \nyourself through their eyes. The experience will be astonishing.\nYou have ABSOLUTE CONTROL over but one thing, and that is your \nthoughts. This is the most significant and inspiring of all facts known to man! It \nreflects man's Divine nature. This Divine prerogative is the sole means by which \nyou may control your own destiny. If you fail to control your own mind, you \nmay be sure you will control nothing else.\nIf you must be careless with your possessions, let it be in connection with \nmaterial things.

This \nform of destruction should be punishable by heavy legal penalties, because it \nmay and often does destroy one's chances of acquiring material things which are \nprotected by law. \nMen with negative minds tried to convince Thomas A.

He knew that the mind could produce ANYTHING THE \nMIND COULD CONCEIVE AND BELIEVE, and that knowledge was the thing \nthat lifted the great Edison above the common herd. \nMen with negative minds told F. W. Woolworth, he would go \"broke\" \ntrying to run a store on five and ten cent sales. He did not believe them. He knew \nthat he could do anything, within reason, if he backed his plans with faith. \nExercising his right to keep other men's negative suggestions out of his mind, he \npiled up a fortune of more than a hundred million dollars.\nMen with negative minds told George Washington he could not hope to \nwin against the vastly superior forces of the British, but he exercised his Divine \nright to BELIEVE, therefore this book was published under the protection of the \nStars and Stripes, while the name of Lord Cornwallis has been all but forgotten.\nDoubting Thomases scoffed scornfully when Henry Ford tried out his first \ncrudely built automobile on the streets of Detroit. Some said the thing never \nwould become practical. Others said no one would pay money for such a \ncontraption. \nFORD SAID, \"I'LL BELT THE EARTH WITH DEPENDABLE MOTOR \nCARS,\" AND HE DID!\nHis decision to trust his own judgment has already piled up a fortune far \ngreater than the next five generations of his descendents can squander. For the \nbenefit of those seeking vast riches, let it be remembered that practically the sole \ndifference between Henry Ford and a majority of the more than one hundred \nthousand men who work for him, is this—FORD HAS A MIND AND \nCONTROLS IT, THE OTHERS HAVE MINDS WHICH THEY DO NOT TRY TO \nCONTROL.\nHenry Ford has been repeatedly mentioned, because he is an astounding \nexample of what a man with a mind of his own, and a will to control it, can \naccomplish. His record knocks the foundation from under that time-worn alibi, \"I \nnever had a chance.\" Ford never had a chance, either, but he CREATED AN \nOPPORTUNITY AND BACKED IT WITH PERSISTENCE UNTIL IT MADE HIM \nRICHER THAN CROESUS. \nMind control is the result of self-discipline and habit. You either control \nyour mind or it controls you. There is no hall-way compromise. The most \npractical of all methods for controlling the mind is the habit of keeping it busy \nwith a definite purpose, backed by a definite plan.

Without this control, success is not possible. \n\"FIFTY-SEVEN\" FAMOUS ALIBIS\nBy Old Man IF\nPeople who do not succeed have one distinguishing trait in common. They \nknow all the reasons for failure, and have what they believe to be air-tight alibis to \nexplain away their own lack of achievement.\nSome of these alibis are clever, and a few of them are justifiable by the \nfacts. But alibis cannot be used for money. The world wants to know only one \nthing—HAVE YOU ACHIEVED SUCCESS? \nA character analyst compiled a list of the most commonly used alibis. As \nyou read the list, examine yourself carefully, and determine how many of these \nalibis, if any, are your own property. Remember, too, the philosophy presented \nin this book makes every one of these alibis obsolete.\nIF I didn't have a wife and family . . .\nIF I had enough \"pull\" . . .\nIF I had money . . .\nIF I had a good education . . .\nIF I could get a job . . .\nIF I had good health . . .\nIF I only had time . . .\nIF times were better . . .\nIF other people understood me . . .\nIF conditions around me were only different . . . \nIF I could live my life over again . . . \nIF I did not fear what \"THEY\" would say . . . \nIF I had been given a chance . . .\nIF I now had a chance . . .\nIF other people didn't \"have it in for me\" . . .\nIF nothing happens to stop me . . .\nIF I were only younger . . .\nIF I could only do what I want . . .\nIF I had been born rich . . .\nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover  How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n  www.think-and-grow-rich-ebook.com  \n246\n  THINK & GROW RICH   \nIF I could meet \"the right people\" . . .\nIF I had the talent that some people have . . .\nIF I dared assert myself . . .\nIF I only had embraced past opportunities . . .\nIF people didn't get on my nerves . . .\nIF I didn't have to keep house and look after the children . . .\nIF I could save some money . . .\nIF the boss only appreciated me . . . \nIF I only had somebody to help me . . .\nIF my family understood me . . .\nIF I lived in a big city . . . \nIF I could just get started . . .\nIF I were only free . . .\nIF I had the personality of some people . . . \nIF I were not so fat . . .\nIF my talents were known . . .\nIF I could just get a \"break\" . . .\nIF I could only get out of debt . . . \nIF I hadn't failed . . .\nIF I only knew how . . . \nIF everybody didn't oppose me . . .\nIF I didn't have so many worries . . . \nIF I could marry the right person . . . \nIF people weren't so dumb . . . \nIF my family were not so extravagant . . .\nIF I were sure of myself . . .\nIF luck were not against me . . .\nIF I had not been born under the wrong star . . . \nIF it were not true that \"what is to be will be\" . . .\nIF I did not have to work so hard . . . \nIF I hadn't lost my money . . .\nIF I lived in a different neighborhood . . . \nIF I didn't have a \"past\" . . .\nIF I only had a business of my own . . .\nIF other people would only listen to me . . .\nIF * * * and this is the greatest of them all * * * I had the courage to see myself as I \nreally am, I would find out what is wrong with me, and correct it, then I might have \nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover  How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n  www.think-and-grow-rich-ebook.com  \n247\n  THINK & GROW RICH   \na chance to profit by my mistakes and learn something from the experience of \nothers, for I know that there is something WRONG with me, or I would now be \nwhere I WOULD HAVE BEEN IF I had spent more time analyzing my \nweaknesses, and less time building alibis to cover them.\nBuilding alibis with which to explain away failure is a national pastime. \nThe habit is as old as the human race, and is fatal to success! Why do people cling \nto their pet alibis? The answer is obvious. They defend their alibis because THEY \nCREATE them! A man's alibi is the child of his own imagination. It is human \nnature to defend one's own brain-child. \nBuilding alibis is a deeply rooted habit. Habits are difficult to break, \nespecially when they provide justification for something we do. Plato had this \ntruth in mind when he said, \"The first and best victory is to conquer self. To be \nconquered by self is, of all things, the most shameful and vile.\" \nAnother philosopher had the same thought in mind when he said, \"It was \na great surprise to me when I discovered that most of the ugliness I saw in \nothers, was but a reflection of my own nature.\" \n\"It has always been a mystery to me,\" said Elbert Hubbard, \"why people \nspend so much time deliberately fooling themselves by creating alibis to cover \ntheir weaknesses. If used differently, this same time would be sufficient to cure \nthe weakness, then no alibis would be needed.\"\nIn parting, I would remind you that \"Life is a checkerboard, and the player \nopposite you is TIME. If you hesitate before moving, or neglect to move \npromptly, your men will be wiped off the board by TIME. You are playing \nagainst a partner who will not tolerate INDECISION!\"\nPreviously you may have had a logical excuse for not having forced Life \nto come through with whatever you asked, but that alibi is now obsolete, because \nyou are in possession of the Master Key that unlocks the door to Life's bountiful \nriches. \nThe Master Key is intangible, but it is powerful! It is the privilege of \ncreating, in your own mind, a BURNING DESIRE for a definite form of riches. \nThere is no penalty for the use of the Key, but there is a price you must pay if you \ndo not use it. The price is FAILURE. There is a reward of stupendous proportions \nif you put the Key to use. It is the satisfaction that comes to all who conquer self \nand force Life to pay whatever is asked.\nThe reward is worthy of your effort.
