In 1922, the psychiatrist Carl Jung chose this\nspot to begin building a retreat. He began with a basic two-story stone\nhouse he called the Tower. After returning from a trip to India, where he\nobserved the practice of adding meditation rooms to homes, he expanded\nthe complex to include a private office. “In my retiring room I am by\nmyself,” Jung said of the space. “I keep the key with me all the time; no one\nelse is allowed in there except with my permission.”\nIn his book Daily Rituals, journalist Mason Currey sorted through\nvarious sources on Jung to re-create the psychiatrist’s work habits at the\nTower. Jung would rise at seven a.m., Currey reports, and after a big\nbreakfast he would spend two hours of undistracted writing time in his\nprivate office. His afternoons would often consist of meditation or long\nwalks in the surrounding countryside. There was no electricity at the Tower,\nso as day gave way to night, light came from oil lamps and heat from the\nfireplace. Jung would retire to bed by ten p.m. “The feeling of repose and\nrenewal that I had in this tower was intense from the start,” he said.\nThough it’s tempting to think of Bollingen Tower as a vacation home, if\nwe put it into the context of Jung’s career at this point it’s clear that the\nlakeside retreat was not built as an escape from work. In 1922, when Jung\nbought the property, he could not afford to take a vacation. Only one year\nearlier, in 1921, he had published Psychological Types, a seminal book that\nsolidified many differences that had been long developing between Jung’s\nthinking and the ideas of his onetime friend and mentor, Sigmund Freud. To\ndisagree with Freud in the 1920s was a bold move. To back up his book,\nJung needed to stay sharp and produce a stream of smart articles and books\nfurther supporting and establishing analytical psychology, the eventual\nname for his new school of thought.\nJung’s lectures and counseling practice kept him busy in Zurich—this is\nclear. But he wasn’t satisfied with busyness alone. He wanted to change the\nway we understood the unconscious, and this goal required deeper, more\ncareful thought than he could manage amid his hectic city lifestyle. Jung\nretreated to Bollingen, not to escape his professional life, but instead to\nadvance it.\nCarl Jung went on to become one of the most influential thinkers of the\ntwentieth century. There are, of course, many reasons for his eventual\nsuccess. In this book, however, I’m interested in his commitment to the\nfollowing skill, which almost certainly played a key role in his\naccomplishments:\nDeep Work: Professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration\nthat push your cognitive capabilities to their limit. These efforts create new value, improve\nyour skill, and are hard to replicate.\nDeep work is necessary to wring every last drop of value out of your\ncurrent intellectual capacity. We now know from decades of research in\nboth psychology and neuroscience that the state of mental strain that\naccompanies deep work is also necessary to improve your abilities. Deep\nwork, in other words, was exactly the type of effort needed to stand out in a\ncognitively demanding field like academic psychiatry in the early twentieth\ncentury.\nThe term “deep work” is my own and is not something Carl Jung would\nhave used, but his actions during this period were those of someone who\nunderstood the underlying concept. Jung built a tower out of stone in the\nwoods to promote deep work in his professional life—a task that required\ntime, energy, and money. It also took him away from more immediate\npursuits. As Mason Currey writes, Jung’s regular journeys to Bollingen\nreduced the time he spent on his clinical work, noting, “Although he had\nmany patients who relied on him, Jung was not shy about taking time off.”\nDeep work, though a burden to prioritize, was crucial for his goal of\nchanging the world.\nIndeed, if you study the lives of other influential figures from both\ndistant and recent history, you’ll find that a commitment to deep work is a\ncommon theme. The sixteenth-century essayist Michel de Montaigne, for\nexample, prefigured Jung by working in a private library he built in the\nsouthern tower guarding the stone walls of his French château, while Mark\nTwain wrote much of The Adventures of Tom Sawyer in a shed on the\nproperty of the Quarry Farm in New York, where he was spending the\nsummer. Twain’s study was so isolated from the main house that his family\ntook to blowing a horn to attract his attention for meals.\nMoving forward in history, consider the screenwriter and director\nWoody Allen. In the forty-four-year period between 1969 and 2013, Woody\nAllen wrote and directed forty-four films that received twenty-three\nAcademy Award nominations—an absurd rate of artistic productivity.\nThroughout this period, Allen never owned a computer, instead completing\nall his writing, free from electronic distraction, on a German Olympia SM3\nmanual typewriter. Allen is joined in his rejection of computers by Peter\nHiggs, a theoretical physicist who performs his work in such disconnected\nisolation that journalists couldn’t find him after it was announced he had\nwon the Nobel Prize. J.K. Rowling, on the other hand, does use a computer,\nbut was famously absent from social media during the writing of her Harry\nPotter novels—even though this period coincided with the rise of the\ntechnology and its popularity among media figures. Rowling’s staff finally\nstarted a Twitter account in her name in the fall of 2009, as she was working\non The Casual Vacancy, and for the first year and a half her only tweet read:\n“This is the real me, but you won’t be hearing from me often I am afraid, as\npen and paper is my priority at the moment.”\nDeep work, of course, is not limited to the historical or technophobic.\nMicrosoft CEO Bill Gates famously conducted “Think Weeks” twice a year,\nduring which he would isolate himself (often in a lakeside cottage) to do\nnothing but read and think big thoughts. It was during a 1995 Think Week\nthat Gates wrote his famous “Internet Tidal Wave” memo that turned\nMicrosoft’s \nattention \nto \nan \nupstart \ncompany \ncalled \nNetscape\nCommunications. And in an ironic twist, Neal Stephenson, the acclaimed\ncyberpunk author who helped form our popular conception of the Internet\nage, is near impossible to reach electronically—his website offers no e-mail\naddress and features an essay about why he is purposefully bad at using\nsocial media. Here’s how he once explained the omission: “If I organize my\nlife in such a way that I get lots of long, consecutive, uninterrupted time-\nchunks, I can write novels. [If I instead get interrupted a lot] what replaces\nit? Instead of a novel that will be around for a long time… there is a bunch\nof e-mail messages that I have sent out to individual persons.”\nThe ubiquity of deep work among influential individuals is important to\nemphasize because it stands in sharp contrast to the behavior of most\nmodern knowledge workers—a group that’s rapidly forgetting the value of\ngoing deep.\nThe reason knowledge workers are losing their familiarity with deep\nwork is well established: network tools. This is a broad category that\ncaptures communication services like e-mail and SMS, social media\nnetworks like Twitter and Facebook, and the shiny tangle of infotainment\nsites like BuzzFeed and Reddit. In aggregate, the rise of these tools,\ncombined with ubiquitous access to them through smartphones and\nnetworked office computers, has fragmented most knowledge workers’\nattention into slivers. A 2012 McKinsey study found that the average\nknowledge worker now spends more than 60 percent of the workweek\nengaged in electronic communication and Internet searching, with close to\n30 percent of a worker’s time dedicated to reading and answering e-mail\nalone.\nThis state of fragmented attention cannot accommodate deep work,\nwhich requires long periods of uninterrupted thinking. At the same time,\nhowever, modern knowledge workers are not loafing. In fact, they report\nthat they are as busy as ever. What explains the discrepancy? A lot can be\nexplained by another type of effort, which provides a counterpart to the idea\nof deep work:\nShallow Work: Noncognitively demanding, logistical-style tasks, often performed while\ndistracted. These efforts tend to not create much new value in the world and are easy to\nreplicate.\nIn an age of network tools, in other words, knowledge workers\nincreasingly replace deep work with the shallow alternative—constantly\nsending and receiving e-mail messages like human network routers, with\nfrequent breaks for quick hits of distraction. Larger efforts that would be\nwell served by deep thinking, such as forming a new business strategy or\nwriting an important grant application, get fragmented into distracted\ndashes that produce muted quality. To make matters worse for depth, there’s\nincreasing evidence that this shift toward the shallow is not a choice that\ncan be easily reversed. Spend enough time in a state of frenetic shallowness\nand you permanently reduce your capacity to perform deep work. “What\nthe Net seems to be doing is chipping away my capacity for concentration\nand contemplation,” admitted journalist Nicholas Carr, in an oft-cited 2008\nAtlantic article. “[And] I’m not the only one.” Carr expanded this argument\ninto a book, The Shallows, which became a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize. To\nwrite The Shallows, appropriately enough, Carr had to move to a cabin and\nforcibly disconnect.\nThe idea that network tools are pushing our work from the deep toward\nthe shallow is not new. The Shallows was just the first in a series of recent\nbooks to examine the Internet’s effect on our brains and work habits. These\nsubsequent titles include William Powers’s Hamlet’s BlackBerry, John\nFreeman’s The Tyranny of E-mail, and Alex Soojung-Kin Pang’s The\nDistraction Addiction—all of which agree, more or less, that network tools\nare distracting us from work that requires unbroken concentration, while\nsimultaneously degrading our capacity to remain focused.\nGiven this existing body of evidence, I will not spend more time in this\nbook trying to establish this point. We can, I hope, stipulate that network\ntools negatively impact deep work. I’ll also sidestep any grand arguments\nabout the long-term societal consequence of this shift, as such arguments\ntend to open impassible rifts. On one side of the debate are techno-skeptics\nlike Jaron Lanier and John Freeman, who suspect that many of these tools,\nat least in their current state, damage society, while on the other side\ntechno-optimists like Clive Thompson argue that they’re changing society,\nfor sure, but in ways that’ll make us better off. Google, for example, might\nreduce our memory, but we no longer need good memories, as in the\nmoment we can now search for anything we need to know.\nI have no stance in this philosophical debate. My interest in this matter\ninstead veers toward a thesis of much more pragmatic and individualized\ninterest: Our work culture’s shift toward the shallow (whether you think it’s\nphilosophically good or bad) is exposing a massive economic and personal\nopportunity for the few who recognize the potential of resisting this trend\nand prioritizing depth—an opportunity that, not too long ago, was leveraged\nby a bored young consultant from Virginia named Jason Benn.\nThere are many ways to discover that you’re not valuable in our economy.\nFor Jason Benn the lesson was made clear when he realized, not long after\ntaking a job as a financial consultant, that the vast majority of his work\nresponsibilities could be automated by a “kludged together” Excel script.\nThe firm that hired Benn produced reports for banks involved in\ncomplex deals. (“It was about as interesting as it sounds,” Benn joked in\none of our interviews.) The report creation process required hours of\nmanual manipulation of data in a series of Excel spreadsheets. When he\nfirst arrived, it took Benn up to six hours per report to finish this stage (the\nmost efficient veterans at the firm could complete this task in around half\nthe time). This didn’t sit well with Benn.\n“The way it was taught to me, the process seemed clunky and manually\nintensive,” Benn recalls. He knew that Excel has a feature called macros\nthat allows users to automate common tasks. Benn read articles on the topic\nand soon put together a new worksheet, wired up with a series of these\nmacros that could take the six-hour process of manual data manipulation\nand replace it, essentially, with a button click. A report-writing process that\noriginally took him a full workday could now be reduced to less than an\nhour.\nBenn is a smart guy. He graduated from an elite college (the University\nof Virginia) with a degree in economics, and like many in his situation he\nhad ambitions for his career. It didn’t take him long to realize that these\nambitions would be thwarted so long as his main professional skills could\nbe captured in an Excel macro. He decided, therefore, he needed to increase\nhis value to the world. After a period of research, Benn reached a\nconclusion: He would, he declared to his family, quit his job as a human\nspreadsheet and become a computer programmer. As is often the case with\nsuch grand plans, however, there was a hitch: Jason Benn had no idea how\nto write code.\nAs a computer scientist I can confirm an obvious point: Programming\ncomputers is hard. Most new developers dedicate a four-year college\neducation to learning the ropes before their first job—and even then,\ncompetition for the best spots is fierce. Jason Benn didn’t have this time.\nAfter his Excel epiphany, he quit his job at the financial firm and moved\nhome to prepare for his next step. His parents were happy he had a plan, but\nthey weren’t happy about the idea that this return home might be long-term.\nBenn needed to learn a hard skill, and needed to do so fast.\nIt’s here that Benn ran into the same problem that holds back many\nknowledge workers from navigating into more explosive career trajectories.\nLearning something complex like computer programming requires intense\nuninterrupted concentration on cognitively demanding concepts—the type\nof concentration that drove Carl Jung to the woods surrounding Lake\nZurich. This task, in other words, is an act of deep work. Most knowledge\nworkers, however, as I argued earlier in this introduction, have lost their\nability to perform deep work. Benn was no exception to this trend.\n“I was always getting on the Internet and checking my e-mail; I couldn’t\nstop myself; it was a compulsion,” Benn said, describing himself during the\nperiod leading up to his quitting his finance job. To emphasize his difficulty\nwith depth, Benn told me about a project that a supervisor at the finance\nfirm once brought to him. “They wanted me to write a business plan,” he\nexplained. Benn didn’t know how to write a business plan, so he decided he\nwould find and read five different existing plans—comparing and\ncontrasting them to understand what was needed. This was a good idea, but\nBenn had a problem: “I couldn’t stay focused.” There were days during this\nperiod, he now admits, when he spent almost every minute (“98 percent of\nmy time”) surfing the Web. The business plan project—a chance to\ndistinguish himself early in his career—fell to the wayside.\nBy the time he quit, Benn was well aware of his difficulties with deep\nwork, so when he dedicated himself to learning how to code, he knew he\nhad to simultaneously teach his mind how to go deep. His method was\ndrastic but effective. “I locked myself in a room with no computer: just\ntextbooks, notecards, and a highlighter.” He would highlight the computer\nprogramming textbooks, transfer the ideas to notecards, and then practice\nthem out loud. These periods free from electronic distraction were hard at\nfirst, but Benn gave himself no other option: He had to learn this material,\nand he made sure there was nothing in that room to distract him. Over time,\nhowever, he got better at concentrating, eventually getting to a point where\nhe was regularly clocking five or more disconnected hours per day in the\nroom, focused without distraction on learning this hard new skill. “I\nprobably read something like eighteen books on the topic by the time I was\ndone,” he recalls.\nAfter two months locked away studying, Benn attended the notoriously\ndifficult Dev Bootcamp: a hundred-hour-a-week crash course in Web\napplication programming. (While researching the program, Benn found a\nstudent with a PhD from Princeton who had described Dev as “the hardest\nthing I’ve ever done in my life.”) Given both his preparation and his newly\nhoned ability for deep work, Benn excelled. “Some people show up not\nprepared,” he said. “They can’t focus. They can’t learn quickly.” Only half\nthe students who started the program with Benn ended up graduating on\ntime. Benn not only graduated, but was also the top student in his class.\nThe deep work paid off. Benn quickly landed a job as a developer at a\nSan Francisco tech start-up with $25 million in venture funding and its pick\nof employees. When Benn quit his job as a financial consultant, only half a\nyear earlier, he was making $40,000 a year. His new job as a computer\ndeveloper paid $100,000—an amount that can continue to grow, essentially\nwithout limit in the Silicon Valley market, along with his skill level.\nWhen I last spoke with Benn, he was thriving in his new position. A\nnewfound devotee of deep work, he rented an apartment across the street\nfrom his office, allowing him to show up early in the morning before\nanyone else arrived and work without distraction. “On good days, I can get\nin four hours of focus before the first meeting,” he told me. “Then maybe\nanother three to four hours in the afternoon. And I do mean ‘focus’: no e-\nmail, no Hacker News [a website popular among tech types], just\nprogramming.” For someone who admitted to sometimes spending up to 98\npercent of his day in his old job surfing the Web, Jason Benn’s\ntransformation is nothing short of astonishing.\nJason Benn’s story highlights a crucial lesson: Deep work is not some\nnostalgic affectation of writers and early-twentieth-century philosophers.\nIt’s instead a skill that has great value today.\nThere are two reasons for this value. The first has to do with learning.\nWe have an information economy that’s dependent on complex systems that\nchange rapidly. Some of the computer languages Benn learned, for\nexample, didn’t exist ten years ago and will likely be outdated ten years\nfrom now. Similarly, someone coming up in the field of marketing in the\n1990s probably had no idea that today they’d need to master digital\nanalytics. To remain valuable in our economy, therefore, you must master\nthe art of quickly learning complicated things. This task requires deep work.\nIf you don’t cultivate this ability, you’re likely to fall behind as technology\nadvances.\nThe second reason that deep work is valuable is because the impacts of\nthe digital network revolution cut both ways. If you can create something\nuseful, its reachable audience (e.g., employers or customers) is essentially\nlimitless—which greatly magnifies your reward. On the other hand, if what\nyou’re producing is mediocre, then you’re in trouble, as it’s too easy for\nyour audience to find a better alternative online. Whether you’re a computer\nprogrammer, writer, marketer, consultant, or entrepreneur, your situation\nhas become similar to Jung trying to outwit Freud, or Jason Benn trying to\nhold his own in a hot start-up: To succeed you have to produce the absolute\nbest stuff you’re capable of producing—a task that requires depth.\nThe growing necessity of deep work is new. In an industrial economy,\nthere was a small skilled labor and professional class for which deep work\nwas crucial, but most workers could do just fine without ever cultivating an\nability to concentrate without distraction. They were paid to crank widgets\n—and not much about their job would change in the decades they kept it.\nBut as we shift to an information economy, more and more of our\npopulation are knowledge workers, and deep work is becoming a key\ncurrency—even if most haven’t yet recognized this reality.\nDeep work is not, in other words, an old-fashioned skill falling into\nirrelevance. It’s instead a crucial ability for anyone looking to move ahead\nin a globally competitive information economy that tends to chew up and\nspit out those who aren’t earning their keep. The real rewards are reserved\nnot for those who are comfortable using Facebook (a shallow task, easily\nreplicated), but instead for those who are comfortable building the\ninnovative distributed systems that run the service (a decidedly deep task,\nhard to replicate). Deep work is so important that we might consider it, to\nuse the phrasing of business writer Eric Barker, “the superpower of the 21st\ncentury.”\nWe have now seen two strands of thought—one about the increasing\nscarcity of deep work and the other about its increasing value—which we\ncan combine into the idea that provides the foundation for everything that\nfollows in this book:\nThe Deep Work Hypothesis: The ability to perform deep work is becoming increasingly\nrare at exactly the same time it is becoming increasingly valuable in our economy. As a\nconsequence, the few who cultivate this skill, and then make it the core of their working life,\nwill thrive.\nThis book has two goals, pursued in two parts. The first, tackled in Part\n1, is to convince you that the deep work hypothesis is true. The second,\ntackled in Part 2, is to teach you how to take advantage of this reality by\ntraining your brain and transforming your work habits to place deep work at\nthe core of your professional life. Before diving into these details, however,\nI’ll take a moment to explain how I became such a devotee of depth.\nI’ve spent the past decade cultivating my own ability to concentrate on hard\nthings. To understand the origins of this interest, it helps to know that I’m a\ntheoretical computer scientist who performed my doctoral training in MIT’s\nfamed Theory of Computation group—a professional setting where the\nability to focus is considered a crucial occupational skill.\nDuring these years, I shared a graduate student office down the hall from\na MacArthur “genius grant” winner—a professor who was hired at MIT\nbefore he was old enough to legally drink. It wasn’t uncommon to find this\ntheoretician sitting in the common space, staring at markings on a\nwhiteboard, with a group of visiting scholars arrayed around him, also\nsitting quietly and staring. This could go on for hours. I’d go to lunch; I’d\ncome back—still staring. This particular professor is hard to reach. He’s not\non Twitter and if he doesn’t know you, he’s unlikely to respond to your e-\nmail. Last year he published sixteen papers.\nThis type of fierce concentration permeated the atmosphere during my\nstudent years. Not surprisingly, I soon developed a similar commitment to\ndepth. To the chagrin of both my friends and the various publicists I’ve\nworked with on my books, I’ve never had a Facebook or Twitter account, or\nany other social media presence outside of a blog. I don’t Web surf and get\nmost of my news from my home-delivered Washington Post and NPR. I’m\nalso generally hard to reach: My author website doesn’t provide a personal\ne-mail address, and I didn’t own my first smartphone until 2012 (when my\npregnant wife gave me an ultimatum—“you have to have a phone that\nworks before our son is born”).\nOn the other hand, my commitment to depth has rewarded me. In the\nten-year period following my college graduation, I published four books,\nearned a PhD, wrote peer-reviewed academic papers at a high rate, and was\nhired as a tenure-track professor at Georgetown University. I maintained\nthis voluminous production while rarely working past five or six p.m.\nduring the workweek.\nThis compressed schedule is possible because I’ve invested significant\neffort to minimize the shallow in my life while making sure I get the most\nout of the time this frees up. I build my days around a core of carefully\nchosen deep work, with the shallow activities I absolutely cannot avoid\nbatched into smaller bursts at the peripheries of my schedule. Three to four\nhours a day, five days a week, of uninterrupted and carefully directed\nconcentration, it turns out, can produce a lot of valuable output.\nMy commitment to depth has also returned nonprofessional benefits. For\nthe most part, I don’t touch a computer between the time when I get home\nfrom work and the next morning when the new workday begins (the main\nexception being blog posts, which I like to write after my kids go to bed).\nThis ability to fully disconnect, as opposed to the more standard practice of\nsneaking in a few quick work e-mail checks, or giving in to frequent\nsurveys of social media sites, allows me to be present with my wife and two\nsons in the evenings, and read a surprising number of books for a busy\nfather of two. More generally, the lack of distraction in my life tones down\nthat background hum of nervous mental energy that seems to increasingly\npervade people’s daily lives. I’m comfortable being bored, and this can be a\nsurprisingly rewarding skill—especially on a lazy D.C. summer night\nlistening to a Nationals game slowly unfold on the radio.\nThis book is best described as an attempt to formalize and explain my\nattraction to depth over shallowness, and to detail the types of strategies that\nhave helped me act on this attraction. I’ve committed this thinking to\nwords, in part, to help you follow my lead in rebuilding your life around\ndeep work—but this isn’t the whole story. My other interest in distilling and\nclarifying these thoughts is to further develop my own practice. My\nrecognition of the deep work hypothesis has helped me thrive, but I’m\nconvinced that I haven’t yet reached my full value-producing potential. As\nyou struggle and ultimately triumph with the ideas and rules in the chapters\nahead, you can be assured that I’m following suit—ruthlessly culling the\nshallow and painstakingly cultivating the intensity of my depth. (You’ll\nlearn how I fare in this book’s conclusion.)\nWhen Carl Jung wanted to revolutionize the field of psychiatry, he built\na retreat in the woods. Jung’s Bollingen Tower became a place where he\ncould maintain his ability to think deeply and then apply the skill to produce\nwork of such stunning originality that it changed the world. In the pages\nahead, I’ll try to convince you to join me in the effort to build our own\npersonal Bollingen Towers; to cultivate an ability to produce real value in\nan increasingly distracted world; and to recognize a truth embraced by the\nmost productive and important personalities of generations past: A deep life\nis a good life.\nPART 1\nThe Idea\nChapter One\nDeep Work Is Valuable\nAs Election Day loomed in 2012, traffic at the New York Times website\nspiked, as is normal during moments of national importance. But this time,\nsomething was different. A wildly disproportionate fraction of this traffic—\nmore than 70 percent by some reports—was visiting a single location in the\nsprawling domain. It wasn’t a front-page breaking news story, and it wasn’t\ncommentary from one of the paper’s Pulitzer Prize–winning columnists; it\nwas instead a blog run by a baseball stats geek turned election forecaster\nnamed Nate Silver. Less than a year later, ESPN and ABC News lured\nSilver away from the Times (which tried to retain him by promising a staff\nof up to a dozen writers) in a major deal that would give Silver’s operation\na role in everything from sports to weather to network news segments to,\nimprobably enough, Academy Awards telecasts. Though there’s debate\nabout the methodological rigor of Silver’s hand-tuned models, there are few\nwho deny that in 2012 this thirty-five-year-old data whiz was a winner in\nour economy.\nAnother winner is David Heinemeier Hansson, a computer programming\nstar who created the Ruby on Rails website development framework, which\ncurrently provides the foundation for some of the Web’s most popular\ndestinations, including Twitter and Hulu. Hansson is a partner in the\ninfluential development firm Basecamp (called 37signals until 2014).\nHansson doesn’t talk publicly about the magnitude of his profit share from\nBasecamp or his other revenue sources, but we can assume they’re lucrative\ngiven that Hansson splits his time between Chicago, Malibu, and Marbella,\nSpain, where he dabbles in high-performance race-car driving.\nOur third and final example of a clear winner in our economy is John\nDoerr, a general partner in the famed Silicon Valley venture capital fund\nKleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers. Doerr helped fund many of the key\ncompanies fueling the current technological revolution, including Twitter,\nGoogle, Amazon, Netscape, and Sun Microsystems. The return on these\ninvestments has been astronomical: Doerr’s net worth, as of this writing, is\nmore than $3 billion.\nWhy have Silver, Hansson, and Doerr done so well? There are two types of\nanswers to this question. The first are micro in scope and focus on the\npersonality traits and tactics that helped drive this trio’s rise. The second\ntype of answers are more macro in that they focus less on the individuals\nand more on the type of work they represent. Though both approaches to\nthis core question are important, the macro answers will prove most\nrelevant to our discussion, as they better illuminate what our current\neconomy rewards.\nTo explore this macro perspective we turn to a pair of MIT economists,\nErik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee, who in their influential 2011 book,\nRace Against the Machine, provide a compelling case that among various\nforces at play, it’s the rise of digital technology in particular that’s\ntransforming our labor markets in unexpected ways. “We are in the early\nthroes of a Great Restructuring,” Brynjolfsson and McAfee explain early in\ntheir book. “Our technologies are racing ahead but many of our skills and\norganizations are lagging behind.” For many workers, this lag predicts bad\nnews. As intelligent machines improve, and the gap between machine and\nhuman abilities shrinks, employers are becoming increasingly likely to hire\n“new machines” instead of “new people.” And when only a human will do,\nimprovements in communications and collaboration technology are making\nremote work easier than ever before, motivating companies to outsource\nkey roles to stars—leaving the local talent pool underemployed.\nThis reality is not, however, universally grim. As Brynjolfsson and\nMcAfee emphasize, this Great Restructuring is not driving down all jobs\nbut is instead dividing them. Though an increasing number of people will\nlose in this new economy as their skill becomes automatable or easily\noutsourced, there are others who will not only survive, but thrive—\nbecoming more valued (and therefore more rewarded) than before.\nBrynjolfsson and McAfee aren’t alone in proposing this bimodal trajectory\nfor the economy. In 2013, for example, the George Mason economist Tyler\nCowen published Average Is Over, a book that echoes this thesis of a digital\ndivision. But what makes Brynjolfsson and McAfee’s analysis particularly\nuseful is that they proceed to identify three specific groups that will fall on\nthe lucrative side of this divide and reap a disproportionate amount of the\nbenefits of the Intelligent Machine Age. Not surprisingly, it’s to these three\ngroups that Silver, Hansson, and Doerr happen to belong. Let’s touch on\neach of these groups in turn to better understand why they’re suddenly so\nvaluable.\nThe High-Skilled Workers\nBrynjolfsson and McAfee call the group personified by Nate Silver the\n“high-skilled” workers. Advances such as robotics and voice recognition\nare automating many low-skilled positions, but as these economists\nemphasize, “other technologies like data visualization, analytics, high speed\ncommunications, and rapid prototyping have augmented the contributions\nof more abstract and data-driven reasoning, increasing the values of these\njobs.” In other words, those with the oracular ability to work with and tease\nvaluable results out of increasingly complex machines will thrive. Tyler\nCowen summarizes this reality more bluntly: “The key question will be: are\nyou good at working with intelligent machines or not?”\nNate Silver, of course, with his comfort in feeding data into large\ndatabases, then siphoning it out into his mysterious Monte Carlo\nsimulations, is the epitome of the high-skilled worker. Intelligent machines\nare not an obstacle to Silver’s success, but instead provide its precondition.\nThe Superstars\nThe ace programmer David Heinemeier Hansson provides an example of\nthe second group that Brynjolfsson and McAfee predict will thrive in our\nnew economy: “superstars.” High-speed data networks and collaboration\ntools like e-mail and virtual meeting software have destroyed regionalism in\nmany sectors of knowledge work. It no longer makes sense, for example, to\nhire a full-time programmer, put aside office space, and pay benefits, when\nyou can instead pay one of the world’s best programmers, like Hansson, for\njust enough time to complete the project at hand. In this scenario, you’ll\nprobably get a better result for less money, while Hansson can service many\nmore clients per year, and will therefore also end up better off.\nThe fact that Hansson might be working remotely from Marbella, Spain,\nwhile your office is in Des Moines, Iowa, doesn’t matter to your company,\nas advances in communication and collaboration technology make the\nprocess near seamless. (This reality does matter, however, to the less-skilled\nlocal programmers living in Des Moines and in need of a steady paycheck.)\nThis same trend holds for the growing number of fields where technology\nmakes productive remote work possible—consulting, marketing, writing,\ndesign, and so on. Once the talent market is made universally accessible,\nthose at the peak of the market thrive while the rest suffer.\nIn a seminal 1981 paper, the economist Sherwin Rosen worked out the\nmathematics behind these “winner-take-all” markets. One of his key\ninsights was to explicitly model talent—labeled, innocuously, with the\nvariable q in his formulas—as a factor with “imperfect substitution,” which\nRosen explains as follows: “Hearing a succession of mediocre singers does\nnot add up to a single outstanding performance.” In other words, talent is\nnot a commodity you can buy in bulk and combine to reach the needed\nlevels: There’s a premium to being the best. Therefore, if you’re in a\nmarketplace where the consumer has access to all performers, and\neveryone’s q value is clear, the consumer will choose the very best. Even if\nthe talent advantage of the best is small compared to the next rung down on\nthe skill ladder, the superstars still win the bulk of the market.\nIn the 1980s, when Rosen studied this effect, he focused on examples\nlike movie stars and musicians, where there existed clear markets, such as\nmusic stores and movie theaters, where an audience has access to different\nperformers and can accurately approximate their talent before making a\npurchasing decision. The rapid rise of communication and collaboration\ntechnologies has transformed many other formerly local markets into a\nsimilarly universal bazaar. The small company looking for a computer\nprogrammer or public relations consultant now has access to an\ninternational marketplace of talent in the same way that the advent of the\nrecord store allowed the small-town music fan to bypass local musicians to\nbuy albums from the world’s best bands. The superstar effect, in other\nwords, has a broader application today than Rosen could have predicted\nthirty years ago. An increasing number of individuals in our economy are\nnow competing with the rock stars of their sectors.\nThe Owners\nThe final group that will thrive in our new economy—the group epitomized\nby John Doerr—consists of those with capital to invest in the new\ntechnologies that are driving the Great Restructuring. As we’ve understood\nsince Marx, access to capital provides massive advantages. It’s also true,\nhowever, that some periods offer more advantages than others. As\nBrynjolfsson and McAfee point out, postwar Europe was an example of a\nbad time to be sitting on a pile of cash, as the combination of rapid inflation\nand aggressive taxation wiped out old fortunes with surprising speed (what\nwe might call the “Downton Abbey Effect”).\nThe Great Restructuring, unlike the postwar period, is a particularly\ngood time to have access to capital. To understand why, first recall that\nbargaining theory, a key component in standard economic thinking, argues\nthat when money is made through the combination of capital investment\nand labor, the rewards are returned, roughly speaking, proportional to the\ninput. As digital technology reduces the need for labor in many industries,\nthe proportion of the rewards returned to those who own the intelligent\nmachines is growing. A venture capitalist in today’s economy can fund a\ncompany like Instagram, which was eventually sold for a billion dollars,\nwhile employing only thirteen people. When else in history could such a\nsmall amount of labor be involved in such a large amount of value? With so\nlittle input from labor, the proportion of this wealth that flows back to the\nmachine owners—in this case, the venture investors—is without precedent.\nIt’s no wonder that a venture capitalist I interviewed for my last book\nadmitted to me with some concern, “Everyone wants my job.”\nLet’s pull together the threads spun so far: Current economic thinking, as\nI’ve surveyed, argues that the unprecedented growth and impact of\ntechnology are creating a massive restructuring of our economy. In this new\neconomy, three groups will have a particular advantage: those who can\nwork well and creatively with intelligent machines, those who are the best\nat what they do, and those with access to capital.\nTo be clear, this Great Restructuring identified by economists like\nBrynjolfsson, McAfee, and Cowen is not the only economic trend of\nimportance at the moment, and the three groups mentioned previously are\nnot the only groups who will do well, but what’s important for this book’s\nargument is that these trends, even if not alone, are important, and these\ngroups, even if they are not the only such groups, will thrive. If you can join\nany of these groups, therefore, you’ll do well. If you cannot, you might still\ndo well, but your position is more precarious.\nThe question we must now face is the obvious one: How does one join\nthese winners? At the risk of quelling your rising enthusiasm, I should first\nconfess that I have no secret for quickly amassing capital and becoming the\nnext John Doerr. (If I had such secrets, it’s unlikely I’d share them in a\nbook.) The other two winning groups, however, are accessible. How to\naccess them is the goal we tackle next.\nHow to Become a Winner in the New Economy\nI just identified two groups that are poised to thrive and that I claim are\naccessible: those who can work creatively with intelligent machines and\nthose who are stars in their field. What’s the secret to landing in these\nlucrative sectors of the widening digital divide? I argue that the following\ntwo core abilities are crucial.\nTwo Core Abilities for Thriving in the New Economy\n1. The ability to quickly master hard things.\n2. The ability to produce at an elite level, in terms of both quality and\nspeed.\nLet’s begin with the first ability. To start, we must remember that we’ve\nbeen spoiled by the intuitive and drop-dead-simple user experience of many\nconsumer-facing technologies, like Twitter and the iPhone. These examples,\nhowever, are consumer products, not serious tools: Most of the intelligent\nmachines driving the Great Restructuring are significantly more complex to\nunderstand and master.\nConsider Nate Silver, our earlier example of someone who thrives by\nworking well with complicated technology. If we dive deeper into his\nmethodology, we discover that generating data-driven election forecasts is\nnot as easy as typing “Who will win more votes?” into a search box. He\ninstead maintains a large database of poll results (thousands of polls from\nmore than 250 pollsters) that he feeds into Stata, a popular statistical\nanalysis system produced by a company called StataCorp. These are not\neasy tools to master. Here, for example, is the type of command you need to\nunderstand to work with a modern database like Silver uses:\nCREATE VIEW cities AS SELECT name, population, altitude FROM capitals\nUNION SELECT name, population, altitude FROM non_capitals;\nDatabases of this type are interrogated in a language called SQL. You\nsend them commands like the one shown here to interact with their stored\ninformation. Understanding how to manipulate these databases is subtle.\nThe example command, for example, creates a “view”: a virtual database\ntable that pulls together data from multiple existing tables, and that can then\nbe addressed by the SQL commands like a standard table. When to create\nviews and how to do so well is a tricky question, one of many that you must\nunderstand and master to tease reasonable results out of real-world\ndatabases.\nSticking with our Nate Silver case study, consider the other technology\nhe relies on: Stata. This is a powerful tool, and definitely not something you\ncan learn intuitively after some modest tinkering. Here, for example, is a\ndescription of the features added to the most recent version of this software:\n“Stata 13 adds many new features such as treatment effects, multilevel\nGLM, power and sample size, generalized SEM, forecasting, effect sizes,\nProject Manager, long strings and BLOBs, and much more.” Silver uses this\ncomplex software—with its generalized SEM and BLOBs—to build\nintricate models with interlocking parts: multiple regressions, conducted on\ncustom parameters, which are then referenced as custom weights used in\nprobabilistic expressions, and so on.\nThe point of providing these details is to emphasize that intelligent\nmachines are complicated and hard to master.* To join the group of those\nwho can work well with these machines, therefore, requires that you hone\nyour ability to master hard things. And because these technologies change\nrapidly, this process of mastering hard things never ends: You must be able\nto do it quickly, again and again.\nThis ability to learn hard things quickly, of course, isn’t just necessary\nfor working well with intelligent machines; it also plays a key role in the\nattempt to become a superstar in just about any field—even those that have\nlittle to do with technology. To become a world-class yoga instructor, for\nexample, requires that you master an increasingly complex set of physical\nskills. To excel in a particular area of medicine, to give another example,\nrequires that you be able to quickly master the latest research on relevant\nprocedures. To summarize these observations more succinctly: If you can’t\nlearn, you can’t thrive.\nNow consider the second core ability from the list shown earlier:\nproducing at an elite level. If you want to become a superstar, mastering the\nrelevant skills is necessary, but not sufficient. You must then transform that\nlatent potential into tangible results that people value. Many developers, for\nexample, can program computers well, but David Hansson, our example\nsuperstar from earlier, leveraged this ability to produce Ruby on Rails, the\nproject that made his reputation. Ruby on Rails required Hansson to push\nhis current skills to their limit and produce unambiguously valuable and\nconcrete results.\nThis ability to produce also applies to those looking to master intelligent\nmachines. It wasn’t enough for Nate Silver to learn how to manipulate large\ndata sets and run statistical analyses; he needed to then show that he could\nuse this skill to tease information from these machines that a large audience\ncared about. Silver worked with many stats geeks during his days at\nBaseball Prospectus, but it was Silver alone who put in the effort to adapt\nthese skills to the new and more lucrative territory of election forecasting.\nThis provides another general observation for joining the ranks of winners\nin our economy: If you don’t produce, you won’t thrive—no matter how\nskilled or talented you are.\nHaving established two abilities that are fundamental to getting ahead in\nour new, technology-disrupted world, we can now ask the obvious follow-\nup question: How does one cultivate these core abilities? It’s here that we\narrive at a central thesis of this book: The two core abilities just described\ndepend on your ability to perform deep work. If you haven’t mastered\nthis foundational skill, you’ll struggle to learn hard things or produce at an\nelite level.\nThe dependence of these abilities on deep work isn’t immediately\nobvious; it requires a closer look at the science of learning, concentration,\nand productivity. The sections ahead provide this closer look, and by doing\nso will help this connection between deep work and economic success shift\nfor you from unexpected to unimpeachable.\nDeep Work Helps You Quickly Learn Hard Things\n“Let your mind become a lens, thanks to the converging rays of attention;\nlet your soul be all intent on whatever it is that is established in your mind\nas a dominant, wholly absorbing idea.”\nThis advice comes from Antonin-Dalmace Sertillanges, a Dominican\nfriar and professor of moral philosophy, who during the early part of the\ntwentieth century penned a slim but influential volume titled The\nIntellectual Life. Sertillanges wrote the book as a guide to “the development\nand deepening of the mind” for those called to make a living in the world of\nideas. Throughout The Intellectual Life, Sertillanges recognizes the\nnecessity of mastering complicated material and helps prepare the reader\nfor this challenge. For this reason, his book proves useful in our quest to\nbetter understand how people quickly master hard (cognitive) skills.\nTo understand Sertillanges’s advice, let’s return to the quote from earlier.\nIn these words, which are echoed in many forms in The Intellectual Life,\nSertillanges argues that to advance your understanding of your field you\nmust tackle the relevant topics systematically, allowing your “converging\nrays of attention” to uncover the truth latent in each. In other words, he\nteaches: To learn requires intense concentration. This idea turns out to be\nahead of its time. In reflecting on the life of the mind in the 1920s,\nSertillanges uncovered a fact about mastering cognitively demanding tasks\nthat would take academia another seven decades to formalize.\nThis task of formalization began in earnest in the 1970s, when a branch\nof psychology, sometimes called performance psychology, began to\nsystematically explore what separates experts (in many different fields)\nfrom everyone else. In the early 1990s, K. Anders Ericsson, a professor at\nFlorida State University, pulled together these strands into a single coherent\nanswer, consistent with the growing research literature, that he gave a\npunchy name: deliberate practice.\nEricsson opens his seminal paper on the topic with a powerful claim:\n“We deny that these differences [between expert performers and normal\nadults] are immutable… Instead, we argue that the differences between\nexpert performers and normal adults reflect a life-long period of deliberate\neffort to improve performance in a specific domain.”\nAmerican culture, in particular, loves the storyline of the prodigy (“Do\nyou know how easy this is for me!?” Matt Damon’s character famously\ncries in the movie Good Will Hunting as he makes quick work of proofs that\nstymie the world’s top mathematicians). The line of research promoted by\nEricsson, and now widely accepted (with caveats*), de-stabilizes these\nmyths. To master a cognitively demanding task requires this specific form\nof practice—there are few exceptions made for natural talent. (On this point\ntoo, Sertillanges seems to have been ahead of his time, arguing in The\nIntellectual Life, “Men of genius themselves were great only by bringing all\ntheir power to bear on the point on which they had decided to show their\nfull measure.” Ericsson couldn’t have said it better.)\nThis brings us to the question of what deliberate practice actually\nrequires. Its core components are usually identified as follows: (1) your\nattention is focused tightly on a specific skill you’re trying to improve or an\nidea you’re trying to master; (2) you receive feedback so you can correct\nyour approach to keep your attention exactly where it’s most productive.\nThe first component is of particular importance to our discussion, as it\nemphasizes that deliberate practice cannot exist alongside distraction, and\nthat it instead requires uninterrupted concentration. As Ericsson\nemphasizes, “Diffused attention is almost antithetical to the focused\nattention required by deliberate practice” (emphasis mine).\nAs psychologists, Ericsson and the other researchers in his field are not\ninterested in why deliberate practice works; they’re just identifying it as an\neffective behavior. In the intervening decades since Ericsson’s first major\npapers on the topic, however, neuroscientists have been exploring the\nphysical mechanisms that drive people’s improvements on hard tasks. As\nthe journalist Daniel Coyle surveys in his 2009 book, The Talent Code,\nthese scientists increasingly believe the answer includes myelin—a layer of\nfatty tissue that grows around neurons, acting like an insulator that allows\nthe cells to fire faster and cleaner. To understand the role of myelin in\nimprovement, keep in mind that skills, be they intellectual or physical,\neventually reduce down to brain circuits. This new science of performance\nargues that you get better at a skill as you develop more myelin around the\nrelevant neurons, allowing the corresponding circuit to fire more\neffortlessly and effectively. To be great at something is to be well\nmyelinated.\nThis understanding is important because it provides a neurological\nfoundation for why deliberate practice works. By focusing intensely on a\nspecific skill, you’re forcing the specific relevant circuit to fire, again and\nagain, in isolation. This repetitive use of a specific circuit triggers cells\ncalled oligodendrocytes to begin wrapping layers of myelin around the\nneurons in the circuits—effectively cementing the skill. The reason,\ntherefore, why it’s important to focus intensely on the task at hand while\navoiding distraction is because this is the only way to isolate the relevant\nneural circuit enough to trigger useful myelination. By contrast, if you’re\ntrying to learn a complex new skill (say, SQL database management) in a\nstate of low concentration (perhaps you also have your Facebook feed\nopen), you’re firing too many circuits simultaneously and haphazardly to\nisolate the group of neurons you actually want to strengthen.\nIn the century that has passed since Antonin-Dalmace Sertillanges first\nwrote about using the mind like a lens to focus rays of attention, we have\nadvanced from this elevated metaphor to a decidedly less poetic explanation\nexpressed in terms of oligodendrocyte cells. But this sequence of thinking\nabout thinking points to an inescapable conclusion: To learn hard things\nquickly, you must focus intensely without distraction. To learn, in other\nwords, is an act of deep work. If you’re comfortable going deep, you’ll be\ncomfortable mastering the increasingly complex systems and skills needed\nto thrive in our economy. If you instead remain one of the many for whom\ndepth is uncomfortable and distraction ubiquitous, you shouldn’t expect\nthese systems and skills to come easily to you.\nDeep Work Helps You Produce at an Elite Level\nAdam Grant produces at an elite level. When I met Grant in 2013, he was\nthe youngest professor to be awarded tenure at the Wharton School of\nBusiness at Penn. A year later, when I started writing this chapter (and was\njust beginning to think about my own tenure process), the claim was\nupdated: He’s now the youngest full professor* at Wharton.\nThe reason Grant advanced so quickly in his corner of academia is\nsimple: He produces. In 2012, Grant published seven articles—all of them\nin major journals. This is an absurdly high rate for his field (in which\nprofessors tend to work alone or in small professional collaborations and do\nnot have large teams of students and postdocs to support their research). In\n2013, this count fell to five. This is still absurdly high, but below his recent\nstandards. He can be excused for this dip, however, because this same year\nhe published a book titled Give and Take, which popularized some of his\nresearch on relationships in business. To say that this book was successful is\nan understatement. It ended up featured on the cover of the New York Times\nMagazine and went on to become a massive bestseller. When Grant was\nawarded full professorship in 2014, he had already written more than sixty\npeer-reviewed publications in addition to his bestselling book.\nSoon after meeting Grant, my own academic career on my mind, I\ncouldn’t help but ask him about his productivity. Fortunately for me, he was\nhappy to share his thoughts on the subject. It turns out that Grant thinks a\nlot about the mechanics of producing at an elite level. He sent me, for\nexample, a collection of PowerPoint slides from a workshop he attended\nwith several other professors in his field. The event was focused on data-\ndriven observations about how to produce academic work at an optimum\nrate. These slides included detailed pie charts of time allocation per season,\na flowchart capturing relationship development with co-authors, and a\nsuggested reading list with more than twenty titles. These business\nprofessors do not live the cliché of the absentminded academic lost in books\nand occasionally stumbling on a big idea. They see productivity as a\nscientific problem to systematically solve—a goal Adam Grant seems to\nhave achieved.\nThough Grant’s productivity depends on many factors, there’s one idea\nin particular that seems central to his method: the batching of hard but\nimportant intellectual work into long, uninterrupted stretches. Grant\nperforms this batching at multiple levels. Within the year, he stacks his\nteaching into the fall semester, during which he can turn all of his attention\nto teaching well and being available to his students. (This method seems to\nwork, as Grant is currently the highest-rated teacher at Wharton and the\nwinner of multiple teaching awards.) By batching his teaching in the fall,\nGrant can then turn his attention fully to research in the spring and summer,\nand tackle this work with less distraction.\nGrant also batches his attention on a smaller time scale. Within a\nsemester dedicated to research, he alternates between periods where his\ndoor is open to students and colleagues, and periods where he isolates\nhimself to focus completely and without distraction on a single research\ntask. (He typically divides the writing of a scholarly paper into three\ndiscrete tasks: analyzing the data, writing a full draft, and editing the draft\ninto something publishable.) During these periods, which can last up to\nthree or four days, he’ll often put an out-of-office auto-responder on his e-\nmail so correspondents will know not to expect a response. “It sometimes\nconfuses my colleagues,” he told me. “They say, ‘You’re not out of office, I\nsee you in your office right now!’” But to Grant, it’s important to enforce\nstrict isolation until he completes the task at hand.\nMy guess is that Adam Grant doesn’t work substantially more hours\nthan the average professor at an elite research institution (generally\nspeaking, this is a group prone to workaholism), but he still manages to\nproduce more than just about anyone else in his field. I argue that his\napproach to batching helps explain this paradox. In particular, by\nconsolidating his work into intense and uninterrupted pulses, he’s\nleveraging the following law of productivity:\nHigh-Quality Work Produced = (Time Spent) x (Intensity of Focus)\nIf you believe this formula, then Grant’s habits make sense: By\nmaximizing his intensity when he works, he maximizes the results he\nproduces per unit of time spent working.\nThis is not the first time I’ve encountered this formulaic conception of\nproductivity. It first came to my attention when I was researching my\nsecond book, How to Become a Straight-A Student, many years earlier.\nDuring that research process, I interviewed around fifty ultra-high-scoring\ncollege undergraduates from some of the country’s most competitive\nschools. Something I noticed in these interviews is that the very best\nstudents often studied less than the group of students right below them on\nthe GPA rankings. One of the explanations for this phenomenon turned out\nto be the formula detailed earlier: The best students understood the role\nintensity plays in productivity and therefore went out of their way to\nmaximize their concentration—radically reducing the time required to\nprepare for tests or write papers, without diminishing the quality of their\nresults.\nThe example of Adam Grant implies that this intensity formula applies\nbeyond just undergraduate GPA and is also relevant to other cognitively\ndemanding tasks. But why would this be? An interesting explanation comes\nfrom Sophie Leroy, a business professor at the University of Minnesota. In\na 2009 paper, titled, intriguingly, “Why Is It So Hard to Do My Work?,”\nLeroy introduced an effect she called attention residue. In the introduction\nto this paper, she noted that other researchers have studied the effect of\nmultitasking—trying to accomplish multiple tasks simultaneously—on\nperformance, but that in the modern knowledge work office, once you got\nto a high enough level, it was more common to find people working on\nmultiple projects sequentially: “Going from one meeting to the next,\nstarting to work on one project and soon after having to transition to another\nis just part of life in organizations,” Leroy explains.\nThe problem this research identifies with this work strategy is that when\nyou switch from some Task A to another Task B, your attention doesn’t\nimmediately follow—a residue of your attention remains stuck thinking\nabout the original task. This residue gets especially thick if your work on\nTask A was unbounded and of low intensity before you switched, but even\nif you finish Task A before moving on, your attention remains divided for a\nwhile.\nLeroy studied the effect of this attention residue on performance by\nforcing task switches in the laboratory. In one such experiment, for\nexample, she started her subjects working on a set of word puzzles. In one\nof the trials, she would interrupt them and tell them that they needed to\nmove on to a new and challenging task, in this case, reading résumés and\nmaking hypothetical hiring decisions. In other trials, she let the subjects\nfinish the puzzles before giving them the next task. In between puzzling and\nhiring, she would deploy a quick lexical decision game to quantify the\namount of residue left from the first task.* The results from this and her\nsimilar experiments were clear: “People experiencing attention residue after\nswitching tasks are likely to demonstrate poor performance on that next\ntask,” and the more intense the residue, the worse the performance.\nThe concept of attention residue helps explain why the intensity formula\nis true and therefore helps explain Grant’s productivity. By working on a\nsingle hard task for a long time without switching, Grant minimizes the\nnegative impact of attention residue from his other obligations, allowing\nhim to maximize performance on this one task. When Grant is working for\ndays in isolation on a paper, in other words, he’s doing so at a higher level\nof effectiveness than the standard professor following a more distracted\nstrategy in which the work is repeatedly interrupted by residue-slathering\ninterruptions.\nEven if you’re unable to fully replicate Grant’s extreme isolation (we’ll\ntackle different strategies for scheduling depth in Part 2), the attention\nresidue concept is still telling because it implies that the common habit of\nworking in a state of semi-distraction is potentially devastating to your\nperformance. It might seem harmless to take a quick glance at your inbox\nevery ten minutes or so. Indeed, many justify this behavior as better than\nthe old practice of leaving an inbox open on the screen at all times (a straw-\nman habit that few follow anymore). But Leroy teaches us that this is not in\nfact much of an improvement. That quick check introduces a new target for\nyour attention. Even worse, by seeing messages that you cannot deal with at\nthe moment (which is almost always the case), you’ll be forced to turn back\nto the primary task with a secondary task left unfinished. The attention\nresidue left by such unresolved switches dampens your performance.\nWhen we step back from these individual observations, we see a clear\nargument form: To produce at your peak level you need to work for\nextended periods with full concentration on a single task free from\ndistraction. Put another way, the type of work that optimizes your\nperformance is deep work. If you’re not comfortable going deep for\nextended periods of time, it’ll be difficult to get your performance to the\npeak levels of quality and quantity increasingly necessary to thrive\nprofessionally. Unless your talent and skills absolutely dwarf those of your\ncompetition, the deep workers among them will outproduce you.\nWhat About Jack Dorsey?\nI’ve now made my argument for why deep work supports abilities that are\nbecoming increasingly important in our economy. Before we accept this\nconclusion, however, we must face a type of question that often arises when\nI discuss this topic: What about Jack Dorsey?\nJack Dorsey helped found Twitter. After stepping down as CEO, he then\nlaunched the payment-processing company Square. To quote a Forbes\nprofile: “He is a disrupter on a massive scale and a repeat offender.” He is\nalso someone who does not spend a lot of time in a state of deep work.\nDorsey doesn’t have the luxury of long periods of uninterrupted thinking\nbecause, at the time when the Forbes profile was written, he maintained\nmanagement duties at both Twitter (where he remained chairman) and\nSquare, leading to a tightly calibrated schedule that ensures that the\ncompanies have a predictable “weekly cadence” (and that also ensures that\nDorsey’s time and attention are severely fractured).\nDorsey reports, for example, that he ends the average day with thirty to\nforty sets of meeting notes that he reviews and filters at night. In the small\nspaces between all these meetings, he believes in serendipitous availability.\n“I do a lot of my work at stand-up tables, which anyone can come up to,”\nDorsey said. “I get to hear all these conversations around the company.”\nThis style of work is not deep. To use a term from our previous section,\nDorsey’s attention residue is likely slathered on thick as he darts from one\nmeeting to another, letting people interrupt him freely in the brief interludes\nin between. And yet, we cannot say that Dorsey’s work is shallow, because\nshallow work, as defined in the introduction, is low value and easily\nreplicable, while what Jack Dorsey does is incredibly valuable and highly\nrewarded in our economy (as of this writing he was among the top one\nthousand richest people in the world, with a net worth over $1.1 billion).\nJack Dorsey is important to our discussion because he’s an exemplar of\na group we cannot ignore: individuals who thrive without depth. When I\ntitled the motivating question of this section “What About Jack Dorsey?,” I\nwas providing a specific example of a more general query: If deep work is\nso important, why are there distracted people who do well? To conclude this\nchapter, I want to address this question so it doesn’t nag at your attention as\nwe dive deeper into the topic of depth in the pages ahead.\nTo start, we must first note that Jack Dorsey is a high-level executive of\na large company (two companies, in fact). Individuals with such positions\nplay a major role in the category of those who thrive without depth, because\nthe lifestyle of such executives is famously and unavoidably distracted.\nHere’s Kerry Trainor, CEO of Vimeo, trying to answer the question of how\nlong he can go without e-mail: “I can go a good solid Saturday without,\nwithout… well, most of the daytime without it… I mean, I’ll check it, but I\nwon’t necessarily respond.”\nAt the same time, of course, these executives are better compensated and\nmore important in the American economy today than in any other time in\nhistory. Jack Dorsey’s success without depth is common at this elite level of\nmanagement. Once we’ve stipulated this reality, we must then step back to\nremind ourselves that it doesn’t undermine the general value of depth.\nWhy? Because the necessity of distraction in these executives’ work lives is\nhighly specific to their particular jobs. A good chief executive is essentially\na hard-to-automate decision engine, not unlike IBM’s Jeopardy!-playing\nWatson system. They have built up a hard-won repository of experience and\nhave honed and proved an instinct for their market. They’re then presented\ninputs throughout the day—in the form of e-mails, meetings, site visits, and\nthe like—that they must process and act on. To ask a CEO to spend four\nhours thinking deeply about a single problem is a waste of what makes him\nor her valuable. It’s better to hire three smart subordinates to think deeply\nabout the problem and then bring their solutions to the executive for a final\ndecision.\nThis specificity is important because it tells us that if you’re a high-level\nexecutive at a major company, you probably don’t need the advice in the\npages that follow. On the other hand, it also tells us that you cannot\nextrapolate the approach of these executives to other jobs. The fact that\nDorsey encourages interruption or Kerry Trainor checks his e-mail\nconstantly doesn’t mean that you’ll share their success if you follow suit:\nTheir behaviors are characteristic of their specific roles as corporate\nofficers.\nThis rule of specificity should be applied to similar counterexamples\nthat come to mind while reading the rest of this book. There are, we must\ncontinually remember, certain corners of our economy where depth is not\nvalued. In addition to executives, we can also include, for example, certain\ntypes of salesmen and lobbyists, for whom constant connection is their most\nvalued currency. There are even those who manage to grind out distracted\nsuccess in fields where depth would help.\nBut at the same time, don’t be too hasty to label your job as necessarily\nnon-deep. Just because your current habits make deep work difficult doesn’t\nmean that this lack of depth is fundamental to doing your job well. In the\nnext chapter, for example, I tell the story of a group of high-powered\nmanagement consultants who were convinced that constant e-mail\nconnectivity was necessary for them to service their clients. When a\nHarvard professor forced them to disconnect more regularly (as part of a\nresearch study), they found, to their surprise, that this connectivity didn’t\nmatter nearly as much as they had assumed. The clients didn’t really need to\nreach them at all times and their performance as consultants improved once\ntheir attention became less fractured.\nSimilarly, several managers I know tried to convince me that they’re\nmost valuable when they’re able to respond quickly to their teams’\nproblems, preventing project logjams. They see their role as enabling\nothers’ productivity, not necessarily protecting their own. Follow-up\ndiscussions, however, soon uncovered that this goal didn’t really require\nattention-fracturing connectivity. Indeed, many software companies now\ndeploy the Scrum project management methodology, which replaces a lot of\nthis ad hoc messaging with regular, highly structured, and ruthlessly\nefficient status meetings (often held standing up to minimize the urge to\nbloviate). This approach frees up more managerial time for thinking deeply\nabout the problems their teams are tackling, often improving the overall\nvalue of what they produce.\nPut another way: Deep work is not the only skill valuable in our\neconomy, and it’s possible to do well without fostering this ability, but the\nniches where this is advisable are increasingly rare. Unless you have strong\nevidence that distraction is important for your specific profession, you’re\nbest served, for the reasons argued earlier in this chapter, by giving serious\nconsideration to depth.\nChapter Two\nDeep Work Is Rare\nIn 2012, Facebook unveiled the plans for a new headquarters designed by\nFrank Gehry. At the center of this new building is what CEO Mark\nZuckerberg called “the largest open floor plan in the world”: More than\nthree thousand employees will work on movable furniture spread over a\nten-acre expanse. Facebook, of course, is not the only Silicon Valley\nheavyweight to embrace the open office concept. When Jack Dorsey, whom\nwe met at the end of the last chapter, bought the old San Francisco\nChronicle building to house Square, he configured the space so that his\ndevelopers work in common spaces on long shared desks. “We encourage\npeople to stay out in the open because we believe in serendipity—and\npeople walking by each other teaching new things,” Dorsey explained.\nAnother big business trend in recent years is the rise of instant\nmessaging. A Times article notes that this technology is no longer the\n“province of chatty teenagers” and is now helping companies benefit from\n“new productivity gains and improvements in customer response time.” A\nsenior product manager at IBM boasts: “We send 2.5 million I.M.’s within\nI.B.M. each day.”\nOne of the more successful recent entrants into the business IM space is\nHall, a Silicon Valley start-up that helps employees move beyond just chat\nand engage in “real-time collaboration.” A San Francisco–based developer I\nknow described to me what it was like to work in a company that uses Hall.\nThe most “efficient” employees, he explained, set up their text editor to\nflash an alert on their screen when a new question or comment is posted to\nthe company’s Hall account. They can then, with a sequence of practiced\nkeystrokes, jump over to Hall, type in their thoughts, and then jump back to\ntheir coding with barely a pause. My friend seemed impressed when\ndescribing their speed.\nA third trend is the push for content producers of all types to maintain a\nsocial media presence. The New York Times, a bastion of old-world media\nvalues, now encourages its employees to tweet—a hint taken by the more\nthan eight hundred writers, editors, and photographers for the paper who\nnow maintain a Twitter account. This is not outlier behavior; it’s instead the\nnew normal. When the novelist Jonathan Franzen wrote a piece for the\nGuardian calling Twitter a “coercive development” in the literary world, he\nwas widely ridiculed as out of touch. The online magazine Slate called\nFranzen’s complaints a “lonely war on the Internet” and fellow novelist\nJennifer Weiner wrote a response in The New Republic in which she argued,\n“Franzen’s a category of one, a lonely voice issuing ex cathedra edicts that\ncan only apply to himself.” The sarcastic hashtag #JonathanFranzenhates\nsoon became a fad.\nI mention these three business trends because they highlight a paradox.\nIn the last chapter, I argued that deep work is more valuable than ever\nbefore in our shifting economy. If this is true, however, you would expect to\nsee this skill promoted not just by ambitious individuals but also by\norganizations hoping to get the most out of their employees. As the\nexamples provided emphasize, this is not happening. Many other ideas are\nbeing prioritized as more important than deep work in the business world,\nincluding, as we just encountered, serendipitous collaboration, rapid\ncommunication, and an active presence on social media.\nIt’s bad enough that so many trends are prioritized ahead of deep work,\nbut to add insult to injury, many of these trends actively decrease one’s\nability to go deep. Open offices, for example, might create more\nopportunities for collaboration,* but they do so at the cost of “massive\ndistraction,” to quote the results of experiments conducted for a British TV\nspecial titled The Secret Life of Office Buildings. “If you are just getting into\nsome work and a phone goes off in the background, it ruins what you are\nconcentrating on,” said the neuroscientist who ran the experiments for the\nshow. “Even though you are not aware at the time, the brain responds to\ndistractions.”\nSimilar issues apply to the rise of real-time messaging. E-mail inboxes,\nin theory, can distract you only when you choose to open them, whereas\ninstant messenger systems are meant to be always active—magnifying the\nimpact of interruption. Gloria Mark, a professor of informatics at the\nUniversity of California, Irvine, is an expert on the science of attention\nfragmentation. In a well-cited study, Mark and her co-authors observed\nknowledge workers in real offices and found that an interruption, even if\nshort, delays the total time required to complete a task by a significant\nfraction. “This was reported by subjects as being very detrimental,” she\nsummarized with typical academic understatement.\nForcing content producers onto social media also has negative effects on\nthe ability to go deep. Serious journalists, for example, need to focus on\ndoing serious journalism—diving into complicated sources, pulling out\nconnective threads, crafting persuasive prose—so to ask them to interrupt\nthis deep thinking throughout the day to participate in the frothy back-and-\nforth of online tittering seems irrelevant (and somewhat demeaning) at best,\nand devastatingly distracting at worst. The respected New Yorker staff\nwriter George Packer captured this fear well in an essay about why he does\nnot tweet: “Twitter is crack for media addicts. It scares me, not because I’m\nmorally superior to it, but because I don’t think I could handle it. I’m afraid\nI’d end up letting my son go hungry.” Tellingly, when he wrote that essay,\nPacker was busy writing his book The Unwinding, which came out soon\nafter and promptly won the National Book Award—despite (or, perhaps,\naided by) his lack of social media use.\nTo summarize, big trends in business today actively decrease people’s\nability to perform deep work, even though the benefits promised by these\ntrends (e.g., increased serendipity, faster responses to requests, and more\nexposure) are arguably dwarfed by the benefits that flow from a\ncommitment to deep work (e.g., the ability to learn hard things fast and\nproduce at an elite level). The goal of this chapter is to explain this paradox.\nThe rareness of deep work, I’ll argue, is not due to some fundamental\nweakness of the habit. When we look closer at why we embrace distraction\nin the workplace we’ll find the reasons are more arbitrary than we might\nexpect—based on flawed thinking combined with the ambiguity and\nconfusion that often define knowledge work. My objective is to convince\nyou that although our current embrace of distraction is a real phenomenon,\nit’s built on an unstable foundation and can be easily dismissed once you\ndecide to cultivate a deep work ethic.\nThe Metric Black Hole\nIn the fall of 2012, Tom Cochran, the chief technology officer of Atlantic\nMedia, became alarmed at how much time he seemed to spend on e-mail.\nSo like any good techie, he decided to quantify this unease. Observing his\nown behavior, he measured that in a single week he received 511 e-mail\nmessages and sent 284. This averaged to around 160 e-mails per day over a\nfive-day workweek. Calculating further, Cochran noted that even if he\nmanaged to spend only thirty seconds per message on average, this still\nadded up to almost an hour and a half per day dedicated to moving\ninformation around like a human network router. This seemed like a lot of\ntime spent on something that wasn’t a primary piece of his job description.\nAs Cochran recalls in a blog post he wrote about his experiment for the\nHarvard Business Review, these simple statistics got him thinking about the\nrest of his company. Just how much time were employees of Atlantic Media\nspending moving around information instead of focusing on the specialized\ntasks they were hired to perform? Determined to answer this question,\nCochran gathered company-wide statistics on e-mails sent per day and the\naverage number of words per e-mail. He then combined these numbers with\nthe employees’ average typing speed, reading speed, and salary. The result:\nHe discovered that Atlantic Media was spending well over a million dollars\na year to pay people to process e-mails, with every message sent or received\ntapping the company for around ninety-five cents of labor costs. “A ‘free\nand frictionless’ method of communication,” Cochran summarized, “had\nsoft costs equivalent to procuring a small company Learjet.”\nTom Cochran’s experiment yielded an interesting result about the literal\ncost of a seemingly harmless behavior. But the real importance of this story\nis the experiment itself, and in particular, its complexity. It turns out to be\nreally difficult to answer a simple question such as: What’s the impact of\nour current e-mail habits on the bottom line? Cochran had to conduct a\ncompany-wide survey and gather statistics from the IT infrastructure. He\nalso had to pull together salary data and information on typing and reading\nspeed, and run the whole thing through a statistical model to spit out his\nfinal result. And even then, the outcome is fungible, as it’s not able to\nseparate out, for example, how much value was produced by this frequent,\nexpensive e-mail use to offset some of its cost.\nThis example generalizes to most behaviors that potentially impede or\nimprove deep work. Even though we abstractly accept that distraction has\ncosts and depth has value, these impacts, as Tom Cochran discovered, are\ndifficult to measure. This isn’t a trait unique to habits related to distraction\nand depth: Generally speaking, as knowledge work makes more complex\ndemands of the labor force, it becomes harder to measure the value of an\nindividual’s efforts. The French economist Thomas Piketty made this point\nexplicit in his study of the extreme growth of executive salaries. The\nenabling assumption driving his argument is that “it is objectively difficult\nto measure individual contributions to a firm’s output.” In the absence of\nsuch measures, irrational outcomes, such as executive salaries way out of\nproportion to the executive’s marginal productivity, can occur. Even though\nsome details of Piketty’s theory are controversial, the underlying\nassumption that it’s increasingly difficult to measure individuals’\ncontributions is generally considered, to quote one of his critics,\n“undoubtedly true.”\nWe should not, therefore, expect the bottom-line impact of depth-\ndestroying behaviors to be easily detected. As Tom Cochran discovered,\nsuch metrics fall into an opaque region resistant to easy measurement—a\nregion I call the metric black hole. Of course, just because it’s hard to\nmeasure metrics related to deep work doesn’t automatically lead to the\nconclusion that businesses will dismiss it. We have many examples of\nbehaviors for which it’s hard to measure their bottom-line impact but that\nnevertheless flourish in our business culture; think, for example, of the three\ntrends that opened this chapter, or the outsize executive salaries that puzzled\nThomas Piketty. But without clear metrics to support it, any business\nbehavior is vulnerable to unstable whim and shifting forces, and in this\nvolatile scrum deep work has fared particularly poorly.\nThe reality of this metric black hole is the backdrop for the arguments\nthat follow in this chapter. In these upcoming sections, I’ll describe various\nmind-sets and biases that have pushed business away from deep work and\ntoward more distracting alternatives. None of these behaviors would\nsurvive long if it was clear that they were hurting the bottom line, but the\nmetric black hole prevents this clarity and allows the shift toward\ndistraction we increasingly encounter in the professional world.\nThe Principle of Least Resistance\nWhen it comes to distracting behaviors embraced in the workplace, we\nmust give a position of dominance to the now ubiquitous culture of\nconnectivity, where one is expected to read and respond to e-mails (and\nrelated communication) quickly. In researching this topic, Harvard Business\nSchool professor Leslie Perlow found that the professionals she surveyed\nspent around twenty to twenty-five hours a week outside the office\nmonitoring e-mail—believing it important to answer any e-mail (internal or\nexternal) within an hour of its arrival.\nYou might argue—as many do—that this behavior is necessary in many\nfast-paced businesses. But here’s where things get interesting: Perlow tested\nthis claim. In more detail, she convinced executives at the Boston\nConsulting Group, a high-pressure management consulting firm with an\ningrained culture of connectivity, to let her fiddle with the work habits of\none of their teams. She wanted to test a simple question: Does it really help\nyour work to be constantly connected? To do so, she did something\nextreme: She forced each member of the team to take one day out of the\nworkweek completely off—no connectivity to anyone inside or outside the\ncompany.\n“At first, the team resisted the experiment,” she recalled about one of the\ntrials. “The partner in charge, who had been very supportive of the basic\nidea, was suddenly nervous about having to tell her client that each member\nof her team would be off one day a week.” The consultants were equally\nnervous and worried that they were “putting their careers in jeopardy.” But\nthe team didn’t lose their clients and its members did not lose their jobs.\nInstead, the consultants found more enjoyment in their work, better\ncommunication among themselves, more learning (as we might have\npredicted, given the connection between depth and skill development\nhighlighted in the last chapter), and perhaps most important, “a better\nproduct delivered to the client.”\nThis motivates an interesting question: Why do so many follow the lead\nof the Boston Consulting Group and foster a culture of connectivity even\nthough it’s likely, as Perlow found in her study, that it hurts employees’\nwell-being and productivity, and probably doesn’t help the bottom line? I\nthink the answer can be found in the following reality of workplace\nbehavior.\nThe Principle of Least Resistance: In a business setting, without clear feedback on the\nimpact of various behaviors to the bottom line, we will tend toward behaviors that are\neasiest in the moment.\nTo return to our question about why cultures of connectivity persist, the\nanswer, according to our principle, is because it’s easier. There are at least\ntwo big reasons why this is true. The first concerns responsiveness to your\nneeds. If you work in an environment where you can get an answer to a\nquestion or a specific piece of information immediately when the need\narises, this makes your life easier—at least, in the moment. If you couldn’t\ncount on this quick response time you’d instead have to do more advance\nplanning for your work, be more organized, and be prepared to put things\naside for a while and turn your attention elsewhere while waiting for what\nyou requested. All of this would make the day to day of your working life\nharder (even if it produced more satisfaction and a better outcome in the\nlong term). The rise of professional instant messaging, mentioned earlier in\nthis chapter, can be seen as this mind-set pushed toward an extreme. If\nreceiving an e-mail reply within an hour makes your day easier, then getting\nan answer via instant message in under a minute would improve this gain\nby an order of magnitude.\nThe second reason that a culture of connectivity makes life easier is that\nit creates an environment where it becomes acceptable to run your day out\nof your inbox—responding to the latest missive with alacrity while others\npile up behind it, all the while feeling satisfyingly productive (more on this\nsoon). If e-mail were to move to the periphery of your workday, you’d be\nrequired to deploy a more thoughtful approach to figuring out what you\nshould be working on and for how long. This type of planning is hard.\nConsider, for example, David Allen’s Getting Things Done task-\nmanagement methodology, which is a well-respected system for\nintelligently managing competing workplace obligations. This system\nproposes a fifteen-element flowchart for making a decision on what to do\nnext! It’s significantly easier to simply chime in on the latest cc’d e-mail\nthread.\nI’m picking on constant connectivity as a case study in this discussion,\nbut it’s just one of many examples of business behaviors that are antithetical\nto depth, and likely reducing the bottom-line value produced by the\ncompany, that nonetheless thrive because, in the absence of metrics, most\npeople fall back on what’s easiest.\nTo name another example, consider the common practice of setting up\nregularly occurring meetings for projects. These meetings tend to pile up\nand fracture schedules to the point where sustained focus during the day\nbecomes impossible. Why do they persist? They’re easier. For many, these\nstanding meetings become a simple (but blunt) form of personal\norganization. Instead of trying to manage their time and obligations\nthemselves, they let the impending meeting each week force them to take\nsome action on a given project and more generally provide a highly visible\nsimulacrum of progress.\nAlso consider the frustratingly common practice of forwarding an e-mail\nto one or more colleagues, labeled with a short open-ended interrogative,\nsuch as: “Thoughts?” These e-mails take the sender only a handful of\nseconds to write but can command many minutes (if not hours, in some\ncases) of time and attention from their recipients to work toward a coherent\nresponse. A little more care in crafting the message by the sender could\nreduce the overall time spent by all parties by a significant fraction. So why\nare these easily avoidable and time-sucking e-mails so common? From the\nsender’s perspective, they’re easier. It’s a way to clear something out of\ntheir inbox—at least, temporarily—with a minimum amount of energy\ninvested.\nThe Principle of Least Resistance, protected from scrutiny by the metric\nblack hole, supports work cultures that save us from the short-term\ndiscomfort of concentration and planning, at the expense of long-term\nsatisfaction and the production of real value. By doing so, this principle\ndrives us toward shallow work in an economy that increasingly rewards\ndepth. It’s not, however, the only trend that leverages the metric black hole\nto reduce depth. We must also consider the always present and always\nvexing demand toward “productivity,” the topic we’ll turn our attention to\nnext.\nBusyness as a Proxy for Productivity\nThere are a lot of things difficult about being a professor at a research-\noriented university. But one benefit that this profession enjoys is clarity.\nHow well or how poorly you’re doing as an academic researcher can be\nboiled down to a simple question: Are you publishing important papers?\nThe answer to this question can even be quantified as a single number, such\nas the h-index: a formula, named for its inventor, Jorge Hirsch, that\nprocesses your publication and citation counts into a single value that\napproximates your impact on your field. In computer science, for example,\nan h-index score above 40 is difficult to achieve and once reached is\nconsidered the mark of a strong long-term career. On the other hand, if your\nh-index is in single digits when your case goes up for tenure review, you’re\nprobably in trouble. Google Scholar, a tool popular among academics for\nfinding research papers, even calculates your h-index automatically so you\ncan be reminded, multiple times per week, precisely where you stand. (In\ncase you’re wondering, as of the morning when I’m writing this chapter,\nI’m a 21.)\nThis clarity simplifies decisions about what work habits a professor\nadopts or abandons. Here, for example, is the late Nobel Prize–winning\nphysicist Richard Feynman explaining in an interview one of his less\northodox productivity strategies:\nTo do real good physics work, you do need absolute solid lengths of\ntime… it needs a lot of concentration… if you have a job\nadministrating anything, you don’t have the time. So I have invented\nanother myth for myself: that I’m irresponsible. I’m actively\nirresponsible. I tell everyone I don’t do anything. If anyone asks me\nto be on a committee for admissions, “no,” I tell them: I’m\nirresponsible.\nFeynman was adamant in avoiding administrative duties because he\nknew they would only decrease his ability to do the one thing that mattered\nmost in his professional life: “to do real good physics work.” Feynman, we\ncan assume, was probably bad at responding to e-mails and would likely\nswitch universities if you had tried to move him into an open office or\ndemand that he tweet. Clarity about what matters provides clarity about\nwhat does not.\nI mention the example of professors because they’re somewhat\nexceptional among knowledge workers, most of whom don’t share this\ntransparency regarding how well they’re doing their job. Here’s the social\ncritic Matthew Crawford’s description of this uncertainty: “Managers\nthemselves inhabit a bewildering psychic landscape, and are made anxious\nby the vague imperatives they must answer to.”\nThough Crawford was speaking specifically to the plight of the\nknowledge work middle manager, the “bewildering psychic landscape” he\nreferences applies to many positions in this sector. As Crawford describes\nin his 2009 ode to the trades, Shop Class as Soulcraft, he quit his job as a\nWashington, D.C., think tank director to open a motorcycle repair shop\nexactly to escape this bewilderment. The feeling of taking a broken\nmachine, struggling with it, then eventually enjoying a tangible indication\nthat he had succeeded (the bike driving out of the shop under its own\npower) provides a concrete sense of accomplishment he struggled to\nreplicate \nwhen \nhis \nday \nrevolved \nvaguely \naround \nreports \nand\ncommunications strategies.\nA similar reality creates problems for many knowledge workers. They\nwant to prove that they’re productive members of the team and are earning\ntheir keep, but they’re not entirely clear what this goal constitutes. They\nhave no rising h-index or rack of repaired motorcycles to point to as\nevidence of their worth. To overcome this gap, many seem to be turning\nback to the last time when productivity was more universally observable:\nthe industrial age.\nTo understand this claim, recall that with the rise of assembly lines came\nthe rise of the Efficiency Movement, identified with its founder, Frederic\nTaylor, who would famously stand with a stopwatch monitoring the\nefficiency of worker movements—looking for ways to increase the speed at\nwhich they accomplished their tasks. In Taylor’s era, productivity was\nunambiguous: widgets created per unit of time. It seems that in today’s\nbusiness landscape, many knowledge workers, bereft of other ideas, are\nturning toward this old definition of productivity in trying to solidify their\nvalue in the otherwise bewildering landscape of their professional lives.\n(David Allen, for example, even uses the specific phrase “cranking\nwidgets” to describe a productive work flow.) Knowledge workers, I’m\narguing, are tending toward increasingly visible busyness because they lack\na better way to demonstrate their value. Let’s give this tendency a name.\nBusyness as Proxy for Productivity: In the absence of clear indicators of what it means\nto be productive and valuable in their jobs, many knowledge workers turn back toward an\nindustrial indicator of productivity: doing lots of stuff in a visible manner.\nThis mind-set provides another explanation for the popularity of many\ndepth-destroying behaviors. If you send and answer e-mails at all hours, if\nyou schedule and attend meetings constantly, if you weigh in on instant\nmessage systems like Hall within seconds when someone poses a new\nquestion, or if you roam your open office bouncing ideas off all whom you\nencounter—all of these behaviors make you seem busy in a public manner.\nIf you’re using busyness as a proxy for productivity, then these behaviors\ncan seem crucial for convincing yourself and others that you’re doing your\njob well.\nThis mind-set is not necessarily irrational. For some, their jobs really do\ndepend on such behavior. In 2013, for example, Yahoo’s new CEO Marissa\nMayer banned employees from working at home. She made this decision\nafter checking the server logs for the virtual private network that Yahoo\nemployees use to remotely log in to company servers. Mayer was upset\nbecause the employees working from home didn’t sign in enough\nthroughout the day. She was, in some sense, punishing her employees for\nnot spending more time checking e-mail (one of the primary reasons to log\nin to the servers). “If you’re not visibly busy,” she signaled, “I’ll assume\nyou’re not productive.”\nViewed objectively, however, this concept is anachronistic. Knowledge\nwork is not an assembly line, and extracting value from information is an\nactivity that’s often at odds with busyness, not supported by it. Remember,\nfor example, Adam Grant, the academic from our last chapter who became\nthe youngest full professor at Wharton by repeatedly shutting himself off\nfrom the outside world to concentrate on writing. Such behavior is the\nopposite of being publicly busy. If Grant worked for Yahoo, Marissa Mayer\nmight have fired him. But this deep strategy turned out to produce a\nmassive amount of value.\nWe could, of course, eliminate this anachronistic commitment to\nbusyness if we could easily demonstrate its negative impact on the bottom\nline, but the metric black hole enters the scene at this point and prevents\nsuch clarity. This potent mixture of job ambiguity and lack of metrics to\nmeasure the effectiveness of different strategies allows behavior that can\nseem ridiculous when viewed objectively to thrive in the increasingly\nbewildering psychic landscape of our daily work.\nAs we’ll see next, however, even those who have a clear understanding\nof what it means to succeed in their knowledge work job can still be lured\naway from depth. All it takes is an ideology seductive enough to convince\nyou to discard common sense.\nThe Cult of the Internet\nConsider Alissa Rubin. She’s the New York Times’ bureau chief in Paris.\nBefore that she was the bureau chief in Kabul, Afghanistan, where she\nreported from the front lines on the postwar reconstruction. Around the time\nI was writing this chapter, she was publishing a series of hard-hitting\narticles that looked at the French government’s complicity in the Rwandan\ngenocide. Rubin, in other words, is a serious journalist who is good at her\ncraft. She also, at what I can only assume is the persistent urging of her\nemployer, tweets.\nRubin’s Twitter profile reveals a steady and somewhat desultory string\nof missives, one every two to four days, as if Rubin receives a regular\nnotice from the Times’ social media desk (a real thing) reminding her to\nappease her followers. With few exceptions, the tweets simply mention an\narticle she recently read and liked.\nRubin is a reporter, not a media personality. Her value to her paper is her\nability to cultivate important sources, pull together facts, and write articles\nthat make a splash. It’s the Alissa Rubins of the world who provide the\nTimes with its reputation, and it’s this reputation that provides the\nfoundation for the paper’s commercial success in an age of ubiquitous and\naddictive click-bait. So why is Alissa Rubin urged to regularly interrupt this\nnecessarily deep work to provide, for free, shallow content to a service run\nby an unrelated media company based out of Silicon Valley? And perhaps\neven more important, why does this behavior seem so normal to most\npeople? If we can answer these questions, we’ll better understand the final\ntrend I want to discuss relevant to the question of why deep work has\nbecome so paradoxically rare.\nA foundation for our answer can be found in a warning provided by the\nlate communication theorist and New York University professor Neil\nPostman. Writing in the early 1990s, as the personal computer revolution\nfirst accelerated, Postman argued that our society was sliding into a\ntroubling relationship with technology. We were, he noted, no longer\ndiscussing the trade-offs surrounding new technologies, balancing the new\nefficiencies against the new problems introduced. If it’s high-tech, we began\nto instead assume, then it’s good. Case closed.\nHe called such a culture a technopoly, and he didn’t mince words in\nwarning against it. “Technopoly eliminates alternatives to itself in precisely\nthe way Aldous Huxley outlined in Brave New World,” he argued in his\n1993 book on the topic. “It does not make them illegal. It does not make\nthem immoral. It does not even make them unpopular. It makes them\ninvisible and therefore irrelevant.”\nPostman died in 2003, but if he were alive today he would likely express\namazement about how quickly his fears from the 1990s came to fruition—a\nslide driven by the unforeseen and sudden rise of the Internet. Fortunately,\nPostman has an intellectual heir to continue this argument in the Internet\nAge: the hypercitational social critic Evgeny Morozov. In his 2013 book, To\nSave Everything, Click Here, Morozov attempts to pull back the curtains on\nour technopolic obsession with “the Internet” (a term he purposefully places\nin scare quotes to emphasize its role as an ideology), saying: “It’s this\npropensity to view ‘the Internet’ as a source of wisdom and policy advice\nthat transforms it from a fairly uninteresting set of cables and network\nrouters into a seductive and exciting ideology—perhaps today’s uber-\nideology.”\nIn Morozov’s critique, we’ve made “the Internet” synonymous with the\nrevolutionary future of business and government. To make your company\nmore like “the Internet” is to be with the times, and to ignore these trends is\nto be the proverbial buggy-whip maker in an automotive age. We no longer\nsee Internet tools as products released by for-profit companies, funded by\ninvestors hoping to make a return, and run by twentysomethings who are\noften making things up as they go along. We’re instead quick to idolize\nthese digital doodads as a signifier of progress and a harbinger of a (dare I\nsay, brave) new world.\nThis Internet-centrism (to steal another Morozov term) is what\ntechnopoly looks like today. It’s important that we recognize this reality\nbecause it explains the question that opened this section. The New York\nTimes maintains a social media desk and pressures its writers, like Alissa\nRubin, toward distracting behavior, because in an Internet-centric\ntechnopoly such behavior is not up for discussion. The alternative, to not\nembrace all things Internet, is, as Postman would say, “invisible and\ntherefore irrelevant.”\nThis invisibility explains the uproar, mentioned earlier, that arose when\nJonathan Franzen dared suggest that novelists shouldn’t tweet. It riled\npeople not because they’re well versed in book marketing and disagreed\nwith Franzen’s conclusion, but because it surprised them that anyone\nserious would suggest the irrelevance of social media. In an Internet-centric\ntechnopoly such a statement is the equivalent of a flag burning—\ndesecration, not debate.\nPerhaps the near universal reach of this mind-set is best captured in an\nexperience I had recently on my commute to the Georgetown campus where\nI work. Waiting for the light to change so I could cross Connecticut Avenue,\nI idled behind a truck from a refrigerated supply chain logistics company.\nRefrigerated shipping is a complex, competitive business that requires equal\nskill managing trade unions and route scheduling. It’s the ultimate old-\nschool industry and in many ways is the opposite of the lean consumer-\nfacing tech start-ups that currently receive so much attention. What struck\nme as I waited in traffic behind this truck, however, was not the complexity\nor scale of this company, but instead a graphic that had been commissioned\nand then affixed, probably at significant expense, on the back of this entire\nfleet of trucks—a graphic that read: “like us on Facebook.”\nDeep work is at a severe disadvantage in a technopoly because it builds\non values like quality, craftsmanship, and mastery that are decidedly old-\nfashioned and nontechnological. Even worse, to support deep work often\nrequires the rejection of much of what is new and high-tech. Deep work is\nexiled in favor of more distracting high-tech behaviors, like the professional\nuse of social media, not because the former is empirically inferior to the\nlatter. Indeed, if we had hard metrics relating the impact of these behaviors\non the bottom line, our current technopoly would likely crumble. But the\nmetric black hole prevents such clarity and allows us instead to elevate all\nthings Internet into Morozov’s feared “uber-ideology.” In such a culture, we\nshould not be surprised that deep work struggles to compete against the\nshiny thrum of tweets, likes, tagged photos, walls, posts, and all the other\nbehaviors that we’re now taught are necessary for no other reason than that\nthey exist.\nBad for Business. Good for You.\nDeep work should be a priority in today’s business climate. But it’s not. I’ve\njust summarized various explanations for this paradox. Among them are the\nrealities that deep work is hard and shallow work is easier, that in the\nabsence of clear goals for your job, the visible busyness that surrounds\nshallow work becomes self-preserving, and that our culture has developed a\nbelief that if a behavior relates to “the Internet,” then it’s good—regardless\nof its impact on our ability to produce valuable things. All of these trends\nare enabled by the difficulty of directly measuring the value of depth or the\ncost of ignoring it.\nIf you believe in the value of depth, this reality spells bad news for\nbusinesses in general, as it’s leading them to miss out on potentially\nmassive increases in their value production. But for you, as an individual,\ngood news lurks. The myopia of your peers and employers uncovers a great\npersonal advantage. Assuming the trends outlined here continue, depth will\nbecome increasingly rare and therefore increasingly valuable. Having just\nestablished that there’s nothing fundamentally flawed about deep work and\nnothing fundamentally necessary about the distracting behaviors that\ndisplace it, you can therefore continue with confidence with the ultimate\ngoal of this book: to systematically develop your personal ability to go deep\n—and by doing so, reap great rewards.\nChapter Three\nDeep Work Is Meaningful\nRic Furrer is a blacksmith. He specializes in ancient and medieval\nmetalworking practices, which he painstakingly re-creates in his shop, Door\nCounty Forgeworks. “I do all my work by hand and use tools that multiply\nmy force without limiting my creativity or interaction with the material,” he\nexplains in his artist’s statement. “What may take me 100 blows by hand\ncan be accomplished in one by a large swaging machine. This is the\nantithesis of my goal and to that end all my work shows evidence of the two\nhands that made it.”\nA 2012 PBS documentary provides a glimpse into Furrer’s world. We\nlearn that he works in a converted barn in Wisconsin farm country, not far\ninland from the scenic Sturgeon Bay of Lake Michigan. Furrer often leaves\nthe barn doors open (to vent the heat of the forges, one suspects), his efforts\nframed by farm fields stretching to the horizon. The setting is idyllic but the\nwork can seem, at first encounter, brutish. In the documentary, Furrer is\ntrying to re-create a Viking-era sword. He begins by using a fifteen-\nhundred-year-old technique to smelt crucible steel: an unusually pure (for\nthe period) form of the metal. The result is an ingot, not much bigger than\nthree or four stacked smartphones. This dense ingot must then be shaped\nand polished into a long and elegant sword blade.\n“This part, the initial breakdown, is terrible,” Furrer says to the camera\nas he methodically heats the ingot, hits it with a hammer, turns it, hits it,\nthen puts it back in the flames to start over. The narrator reveals that it will\ntake eight hours of this hammering to complete the shaping. As you watch\nFurrer work, however, the sense of the labor shifts. It becomes clear that\nhe’s not drearily whacking at the metal like a miner with a pickaxe: Every\nhit, though forceful, is carefully controlled. He peers intently at the metal,\nthrough thin-framed intellectual glasses (which seem out of place perched\nabove his heavy beard and broad shoulders), turning it just so for each\nimpact. “You have to be very gentle with it or you will crack it,” he\nexplains. After a few more hammer strikes, he adds: “You have to nudge it;\nslowly it breaks down; then you start to enjoy it.”\nAt one point about halfway through the smithing, after Furrer has\nfinished hammering out the desired shape, he begins rotating the metal\ncarefully in a narrow trough of burning charcoal. As he stares at the blade\nsomething clicks: “It’s ready.” He lifts the sword, red with heat, holding it\naway from his body as he strides swiftly toward a pipe filled with oil and\nplunges in the blade to cool it. After a moment of relief that the blade did\nnot crack into pieces—a common occurrence at this step—Furrer pulls it\nfrom the oil. The residual heat of the metal lights the fuel, engulfing the\nsword’s full length in yellow flames. Furrer holds the burning sword up\nabove his head with a single powerful arm and stares at it a moment before\nblowing out the fire. During this brief pause, the flames illuminate his face,\nand his admiration is palpable.\n“To do it right, it is the most complicated thing I know how to make,”\nFurrer explains. “And it’s that challenge that drives me. I don’t need a\nsword. But I have to make them.”\nRic Furrer is a master craftsman whose work requires him to spend most of\nhis day in a state of depth—even a small slip in concentration can ruin\ndozens of hours of effort. He’s also someone who clearly finds great\nmeaning in his profession. This connection between deep work and a good\nlife is familiar and widely accepted when considering the world of\ncraftsmen. “The satisfactions of manifesting oneself concretely in the world\nthrough manual competence have been known to make a man quiet and\neasy,” explains Matthew Crawford. And we believe him.\nBut when we shift our attention to knowledge work this connection is\nmuddied. Part of the issue is clarity. Craftsmen like Furrer tackle\nprofessional challenges that are simple to define but difficult to execute—a\nuseful imbalance when seeking purpose. Knowledge work exchanges this\nclarity for ambiguity. It can be hard to define exactly what a given\nknowledge worker does and how it differs from another: On our worst days,\nit can seem that all knowledge work boils down to the same exhausting roil\nof e-mails and PowerPoint, with only the charts used in the slides\ndifferentiating one career from another. Furrer himself identifies this\nblandness when he writes: “The world of information superhighways and\ncyber space has left me rather cold and disenchanted.”\nAnother issue muddying the connection between depth and meaning in\nknowledge work is the cacophony of voices attempting to convince\nknowledge workers to spend more time engaged in shallow activities. As\nelaborated in the last chapter, we live in an era where anything Internet\nrelated is understood by default to be innovative and necessary. Depth-\ndestroying behaviors such as immediate e-mail responses and an active\nsocial media presence are lauded, while avoidance of these trends generates\nsuspicion. No one would fault Ric Furrer for not using Facebook, but if a\nknowledge worker makes this same decision, then he’s labeled an eccentric\n(as I’ve learned from personal experience).\nJust because this connection between depth and meaning is less clear in\nknowledge work, however, doesn’t mean that it’s nonexistent. The goal of\nthis chapter is to convince you that deep work can generate as much\nsatisfaction in an information economy as it so clearly does in a craft\neconomy. In the sections ahead, I’ll make three arguments to support this\nclaim. These arguments roughly follow a trajectory from the conceptually\nnarrow to broad: starting with a neurological perspective, moving to the\npsychological, and ending with the philosophical. I’ll show that regardless\nof the angle from which you attack the issue of depth and knowledge work,\nit’s clear that by embracing depth over shallowness you can tap the same\nveins of meaning that drive craftsmen like Ric Furrer. The thesis of this\nfinal chapter in Part 1, therefore, is that a deep life is not just economically\nlucrative, but also a life well lived.\nA Neurological Argument for Depth\nThe science writer Winifred Gallagher stumbled onto a connection between\nattention and happiness after an unexpected and terrifying event, a cancer\ndiagnosis—“not just cancer,” she clarifies, “but a particularly nasty, fairly\nadvanced kind.” As Gallagher recalls in her 2009 book Rapt, as she walked\naway from the hospital after the diagnosis she formed a sudden and strong\nintuition: “This disease wanted to monopolize my attention, but as much as\npossible, I would focus on my life instead.” The cancer treatment that\nfollowed was exhausting and terrible, but Gallagher couldn’t help noticing,\nin that corner of her brain honed by a career in nonfiction writing, that her\ncommitment to focus on what was good in her life—“movies, walks, and a\n6:30 martini”—worked surprisingly well. Her life during this period should\nhave been mired in fear and pity, but it was instead, she noted, often quite\npleasant.\nHer curiosity piqued, Gallagher set out to better understand the role that\nattention—that is, what we choose to focus on and what we choose to\nignore—plays in defining the quality of our life. After five years of science\nreporting, she came away convinced that she was witness to a “grand\nunified theory” of the mind:\nLike fingers pointing to the moon, other diverse disciplines from\nanthropology to education, behavioral economics to family\ncounseling, similarly suggest that the skillful management of\nattention is the sine qua non of the good life and the key to improving\nvirtually every aspect of your experience.\nThis concept upends the way most people think about their subjective\nexperience of life. We tend to place a lot of emphasis on our circumstances,\nassuming that what happens to us (or fails to happen) determines how we\nfeel. From this perspective, the small-scale details of how you spend your\nday aren’t that important, because what matters are the large-scale\noutcomes, such as whether or not you get a promotion or move to that nicer\napartment. According to Gallagher, decades of research contradict this\nunderstanding. Our brains instead construct our worldview based on what\nwe pay attention to. If you focus on a cancer diagnosis, you and your life\nbecome unhappy and dark, but if you focus instead on an evening martini,\nyou and your life become more pleasant—even though the circumstances in\nboth scenarios are the same. As Gallagher summarizes: “Who you are, what\nyou think, feel, and do, what you love—is the sum of what you focus on.”\nIn Rapt, Gallagher surveys the research supporting this understanding of\nthe mind. She cites, for example, the University of North Carolina\npsychologist Barbara Fredrickson: a researcher who specializes in the\ncognitive appraisal of emotions. After a bad or disrupting occurrence in\nyour life, Fredrickson’s research shows, what you choose to focus on exerts\nsignificant leverage on your attitude going forward. These simple choices\ncan provide a “reset button” to your emotions. She provides the example of\na couple fighting over inequitable splitting of household chores. “Rather\nthan continuing to focus on your partner’s selfishness and sloth,” she\nsuggests, “you might focus on the fact that at least a festering conflict has\nbeen aired, which is the first step toward a solution to the problem, and to\nyour improved mood.” This seems like a simple exhortation to look on the\nbright side, but Fredrickson found that skillful use of these emotional\n“leverage points” can generate a significantly more positive outcome after\nnegative events.\nScientists can watch this effect in action all the way down to the\nneurological level. Stanford psychologist Laura Carstensen, to name one\nsuch example, used an fMRI scanner to study the brain behavior of subjects\npresented with both positive and negative imagery. She found that for\nyoung people, their amygdala (a center of emotion) fired with activity at\nboth types of imagery. When she instead scanned the elderly, the amygdala\nfired only for the positive images. Carstensen hypothesizes that the elderly\nsubjects had trained the prefrontal cortex to inhibit the amygdala in the\npresence of negative stimuli. These elderly subjects were not happier\nbecause their life circumstances were better than those of the young\nsubjects; they were instead happier because they had rewired their brains to\nignore the negative and savor the positive. By skillfully managing their\nattention, they improved their world without changing anything concrete\nabout it.\nWe can now step back and use Gallagher’s grand theory to better\nunderstand the role of deep work in cultivating a good life. This theory tells\nus that your world is the outcome of what you pay attention to, so consider\nfor a moment the type of mental world constructed when you dedicate\nsignificant time to deep endeavors. There’s a gravity and sense of\nimportance inherent in deep work—whether you’re Ric Furrer smithing a\nsword or a computer programmer optimizing an algorithm. Gallagher’s\ntheory, therefore, predicts that if you spend enough time in this state, your\nmind will understand your world as rich in meaning and importance.\nThere is, however, a hidden but equally important benefit to cultivating\nrapt attention in your workday: Such concentration hijacks your attention\napparatus, preventing you from noticing the many smaller and less pleasant\nthings that unavoidably and persistently populate our lives. (The\npsychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, whom we’ll learn more about in the\nnext section, explicitly identifies this advantage when he emphasizes the\nadvantage of cultivating “concentration so intense that there is no attention\nleft over to think about anything irrelevant, or to worry about problems.”)\nThis danger is especially pronounced in knowledge work, which due to its\ndependence on ubiquitous connectivity generates a devastatingly appealing\nbuffet of distraction—most of which will, if given enough attention, leach\nmeaning and importance from the world constructed by your mind.\nTo help make this claim more concrete I’ll use myself as a test case.\nConsider, for example, the last five e-mails I sent before I began writing the\nfirst draft of this chapter. Following are the subject lines of these messages\nalong with summaries of their contents:\n• Re: URGENT calnewport Brand Registration Confirmation. This\nmessage was in response to a standard scam in which a company tries\nto trick website owners into registering their domain in China. I was\nannoyed that they kept spamming me, so I lost my cool and\nresponded (futilely, of course) by telling them their scam would be\nmore convincing if they spelled “website” correctly in their e-mails.\n• Re: S R. This message was a conversation with a family member\nabout an article he saw in the Wall Street Journal.\n• Re: Important Advice. This e-mail was part of a conversation about\noptimal retirement investment strategies.\n• Re: Fwd: Study Hacks. This e-mail was part of a conversation in\nwhich I was attempting to find a time to meet with someone I know\nwho was visiting my city—a task complicated by his fractured\nschedule during his visit.\n• Re: just curious. This message was part of a conversation in which a\ncolleague and I were reacting to some thorny office politics issues (of\nthe type that are frequent and clichéd in academic departments).\nThese e-mails provide a nice case study of the type of shallow concerns\nthat vie for your attention in a knowledge work setting. Some of the issues\npresented in these sample messages are benign, such as discussing an\ninteresting article, some are vaguely stressful, such as the conversation on\nretirement savings strategies (a type of conversation which almost always\nconcludes with you not doing the right things), some are frustrating, such as\ntrying to arrange a meeting around busy schedules, and some are explicitly\nnegative, such as angry responses to scammers or worried discussions about\noffice politics.\nMany knowledge workers spend most of their working day interacting\nwith these types of shallow concerns. Even when they’re required to\ncomplete something more involved, the habit of frequently checking\ninboxes ensures that these issues remain at the forefront of their attention.\nGallagher teaches us that this is a foolhardy way to go about your day, as it\nensures that your mind will construct an understanding of your working life\nthat’s dominated by stress, irritation, frustration, and triviality. The world\nrepresented by your inbox, in other words, isn’t a pleasant world to inhabit.\nEven if your colleagues are all genial and your interactions are always\nupbeat and positive, by allowing your attention to drift over the seductive\nlandscape of the shallow, you run the risk of falling into another\nneurological trap identified by Gallagher: “Five years of reporting on\nattention have confirmed some home truths,” Gallagher reports. “[Among\nthem is the notion that] ‘the idle mind is the devil’s workshop’… when you\nlose focus, your mind tends to fix on what could be wrong with your life\ninstead of what’s right.” A workday driven by the shallow, from a\nneurological perspective, is likely to be a draining and upsetting day, even if\nmost of the shallow things that capture your attention seem harmless or fun.\nThe implication of these findings is clear. In work (and especially\nknowledge work), to increase the time you spend in a state of depth is to\nleverage the complex machinery of the human brain in a way that for\nseveral different neurological reasons maximizes the meaning and\nsatisfaction you’ll associate with your working life. “After running my\ntough experiment [with cancer]… I have a plan for living the rest of my\nlife,” Gallagher concludes in her book. “I’ll choose my targets with care…\nthen give them my rapt attention. In short, I’ll live the focused life, because\nit’s the best kind there is.” We’d be wise to follow her lead.\nA Psychological Argument for Depth\nOur second argument for why depth generates meaning comes from the\nwork of one of the world’s best-known (and most misspelled)\npsychologists, \nMihaly \nCsikszentmihalyi. \nIn \nthe \nearly \n1980s,\nCsikszentmihalyi, working with Reed Larson, a young colleague at the\nUniversity of Chicago, invented a new technique for understanding the\npsychological impact of everyday behaviors. At the time, it was difficult to\naccurately measure the psychological impact of different activities. If you\nbrought someone into a laboratory and asked her to remember how she felt\nat a specific point many hours ago, she was unlikely to recall. If you instead\ngave her a diary and asked her to record how she felt throughout the day,\nshe wouldn’t be likely to keep up the entries with diligence—it’s simply too\nmuch work.\nCsikszentmihalyi and Larson’s breakthrough was to leverage new\ntechnology (for the time) to bring the question to the subject right when it\nmattered. In more detail, they outfitted experimental subjects with pagers.\nThese pagers would beep at randomly selected intervals (in modern\nincarnations of this method, smartphone apps play the same role). When the\nbeeper went off, the subjects would record what they were doing at the\nexact moment and how they felt. In some cases, they would be provided\nwith a journal in which to record this information while in others they\nwould be given a phone number to call to answer questions posed by a\nfield-worker. Because the beeps were only occasional but hard to ignore,\nthe subjects were likely to follow through with the experimental procedure.\nAnd because the subjects were recording responses about an activity at the\nvery moment they were engaged in it, the responses were more accurate.\nCsikszentmihalyi and Larson called the approach the experience sampling\nmethod (ESM), and it provided unprecedented insight into how we actually\nfeel about the beats of our daily lives.\nAmong many breakthroughs, Csikszentmihalyi’s work with ESM helped\nvalidate a theory he had been developing over the preceding decade: “The\nbest moments usually occur when a person’s body or mind is stretched to its\nlimits in a voluntary effort to accomplish something difficult and\nworthwhile.” Csikszentmihalyi calls this mental state flow (a term he\npopularized with a 1990 book of the same title). At the time, this finding\npushed back against conventional wisdom. Most people assumed (and still\ndo) that relaxation makes them happy. We want to work less and spend\nmore time in the hammock. But the results from Csikszentmihalyi’s ESM\nstudies reveal that most people have this wrong:\nIronically, jobs are actually easier to enjoy than free time, because\nlike flow activities they have built-in goals, feedback rules, and\nchallenges, all of which encourage one to become involved in one’s\nwork, to concentrate and lose oneself in it. Free time, on the other\nhand, is unstructured, and requires much greater effort to be shaped\ninto something that can be enjoyed.\nWhen measured empirically, people were happier at work and less\nhappy relaxing than they suspected. And as the ESM studies confirmed, the\nmore such flow experiences that occur in a given week, the higher the\nsubject’s life satisfaction. Human beings, it seems, are at their best when\nimmersed deeply in something challenging.\nThere is, of course, overlap between the theory of flow and the ideas of\nWinifred Gallagher highlighted in the last section. Both point toward the\nimportance of depth over shallowness, but they focus on two different\nexplanations for this importance. Gallagher’s writing emphasizes that the\ncontent of what we focus on matters. If we give rapt attention to important\nthings, and therefore also ignore shallow negative things, we’ll experience\nour working life as more important and positive. Csikszentmihalyi’s theory\nof flow, by contrast, is mostly agnostic to the content of our attention.\nThough he would likely agree with the research cited by Gallagher, his\ntheory notes that the feeling of going deep is in itself very rewarding. Our\nminds like this challenge, regardless of the subject.\nThe connection between deep work and flow should be clear: Deep work is\nan activity well suited to generate a flow state (the phrases used by\nCsikszentmihalyi to describe what generates flow include notions of\nstretching your mind to its limits, concentrating, and losing yourself in an\nactivity—all of which also describe deep work). And as we just learned,\nflow generates happiness. Combining these two ideas we get a powerful\nargument from psychology in favor of depth. Decades of research stemming\nfrom Csikszentmihalyi’s original ESM experiments validate that the act of\ngoing deep orders the consciousness in a way that makes life worthwhile.\nCsikszentmihalyi even goes so far as to argue that modern companies\nshould embrace this reality, suggesting that “jobs should be redesigned so\nthat they resemble as closely as possible flow activities.” Noting, however,\nthat such a redesign would be difficult and disruptive (see, for example, my\narguments from the previous chapter), Csikszentmihalyi then explains that\nit’s even more important that the individual learn how to seek out\nopportunities for flow. This, ultimately, is the lesson to come away with\nfrom our brief foray into the world of experimental psychology: To build\nyour working life around the experience of flow produced by deep work is a\nproven path to deep satisfaction.\nA Philosophical Argument for Depth\nOur final argument for the connection between depth and meaning requires\nus to step back from the more concrete worlds of neuroscience and\npsychology and instead adopt a philosophical perspective. I’ll turn for help\nin this discussion to a pair of scholars who know this topic well: Hubert\nDreyfus, who taught philosophy at Berkeley for more than four decades,\nand Sean Dorrance Kelly, who at the time of this writing is the chair of\nHarvard’s philosophy department. In 2011, Dreyfus and Kelly published a\nbook, All Things Shining, which explores how notions of sacredness and\nmeaning have evolved throughout the history of human culture. They set\nout to reconstruct this history because they’re worried about its endpoint in\nour current era. “The world used to be, in its various forms, a world of\nsacred, shining things,” Dreyfus and Kelly explain early in the book. “The\nshining things now seem far away.”\nWhat happened between then and now? The short answer, the authors\nargue, is Descartes. From Descartes’s skepticism came the radical belief\nthat the individual seeking certainty trumped a God or king bestowing truth.\nThe resulting Enlightenment, of course, led to the concept of human rights\nand freed many from oppression. But as Dreyfus and Kelly emphasize, for\nall its good in the political arena, in the domain of the metaphysical this\nthinking stripped the world of the order and sacredness essential to creating\nmeaning. In a post-Enlightenment world we have tasked ourselves to\nidentify what’s meaningful and what’s not, an exercise that can seem\narbitrary and induce a creeping nihilism. “The Enlightenment’s\nmetaphysical embrace of the autonomous individual leads not just to a\nboring life,” Dreyfus and Kelly worry; “it leads almost inevitably to a\nnearly unlivable one.”\nThis problem might at first seem far removed from our quest to\nunderstand the satisfaction of depth, but when we proceed to Dreyfus and\nKelly’s solution, we will discover rich new insights into the sources of\nmeaning in professional pursuits. This connection should seem less\nsurprising when it’s revealed that Dreyfus and Kelly’s response to modern\nnihilism builds on the very subject that opened this chapter: the craftsman.\nCraftsmanship, Dreyfus and Kelly argue in their book’s conclusion,\nprovides a key to reopening a sense of sacredness in a responsible manner.\nTo illustrate this claim, they use as an organizing example an account of a\nmaster wheelwright—the now lost profession of shaping wooden wagon\nwheels. “Because each piece of wood is distinct, it has its own personality,”\nthey write after a passage describing the details of the wheelwright’s craft.\n“The woodworker has an intimate relationship with the wood he works. Its\nsubtle virtues call out to be cultivated and cared for.” In this appreciation\nfor the “subtle virtues” of his medium, they note, the craftsman has\nstumbled onto something crucial in a post-Enlightenment world: a source of\nmeaning sited outside the individual. The wheelwright doesn’t decide\narbitrarily which virtues of the wood he works are valuable and which are\nnot; this value is inherent in the wood and the task it’s meant to perform.\nAs Dreyfus and Kelly explain, such sacredness is common to\ncraftsmanship. The task of a craftsman, they conclude, “is not to generate\nmeaning, but rather to cultivate in himself the skill of discerning the\nmeanings that are already there.” This frees the craftsman of the nihilism of\nautonomous individualism, providing an ordered world of meaning. At the\nsame time, this meaning seems safer than the sources cited in previous eras.\nThe wheelwright, the authors imply, cannot easily use the inherent quality\nof a piece of pine to justify a despotic monarchy.\nReturning to the question of professional satisfaction, Dreyfus and Kelly’s\ninterpretation of craftsmanship as a path to meaning provides a nuanced\nunderstanding of why the work of those like Ric Furrer resonates with so\nmany of us. The look of satisfaction on Furrer’s face as he works to extract\nartistry from crude metals, these philosophers would argue, is a look\nexpressing appreciation for something elusive and valuable in modernity: a\nglimpse of the sacred.\nOnce understood, we can connect this sacredness inherent in traditional\ncraftsmanship to the world of knowledge work. To do so, there are two key\nobservations we must first make. The first might be obvious but requires\nemphasis: There’s nothing intrinsic about the manual trades when it comes\nto generating this particular source of meaning. Any pursuit—be it physical\nor cognitive—that supports high levels of skill can also generate a sense of\nsacredness.\nTo elaborate this point, let’s jump from the old-fashioned examples of\ncarving wood or smithing metal to the modern example of computer\nprogramming. Consider this quote from the coding prodigy Santiago\nGonzalez describing his work to an interviewer:\nBeautiful code is short and concise, so if you were to give that code\nto another programmer they would say, “oh, that’s well written\ncode.” It’s much like as if you were writing a poem.\nGonzalez discusses computer programming similarly to the way\nwoodworkers discuss their craft in the passages quoted by Dreyfus and\nKelly.\nThe Pragmatic Programmer, a well-regarded book in the computer\nprogramming field, makes this connection between code and old-style\ncraftsmanship more directly by quoting the medieval quarry worker’s creed\nin its preface: “We who cut mere stones must always be envisioning\ncathedrals.” The book then elaborates that computer programmers must see\ntheir work in the same way:\nWithin the overall structure of a project there is always room for\nindividuality and craftsmanship… One hundred years from now, our\nengineering may seem as archaic as the techniques used by medieval\ncathedral builders seem to today’s civil engineers, while our\ncraftsmanship will still be honored.\nYou don’t, in other words, need to be toiling in an open-air barn for your\nefforts to be considered the type of craftsmanship that can generate Dreyfus\nand Kelly’s meaning. A similar potential for craftsmanship can be found in\nmost skilled jobs in the information economy. Whether you’re a writer,\nmarketer, consultant, or lawyer: Your work is craft, and if you hone your\nability and apply it with respect and care, then like the skilled wheelwright\nyou can generate meaning in the daily efforts of your professional life.\nIt’s here that some might respond that their knowledge work job cannot\npossibly become such a source of meaning because their job’s subject is\nmuch too mundane. But this is flawed thinking that our consideration of\ntraditional craftsmanship can help correct. In our current culture, we place a\nlot of emphasis on job description. Our obsession with the advice to “follow\nyour passion” (the subject of my last book), for example, is motivated by\nthe (flawed) idea that what matters most for your career satisfaction is the\nspecifics of the job you choose. In this way of thinking, there are some\nrarified jobs that can be a source of satisfaction—perhaps working in a\nnonprofit or starting a software company—while all others are soulless and\nbland. The philosophy of Dreyfus and Kelly frees us from such traps. The\ncraftsmen they cite don’t have rarified jobs. Throughout most of human\nhistory, to be a blacksmith or a wheelwright wasn’t glamorous. But this\ndoesn’t matter, as the specifics of the work are irrelevant. The meaning\nuncovered by such efforts is due to the skill and appreciation inherent in\ncraftsmanship—not the outcomes of their work. Put another way, a wooden\nwheel is not noble, but its shaping can be. The same applies to knowledge\nwork. You don’t need a rarified job; you need instead a rarified approach to\nyour work.\nThe second key observation about this line of argument is that\ncultivating craftsmanship is necessarily a deep task and therefore requires a\ncommitment to deep work. (Recall that I argued in Chapter 1 that deep\nwork is necessary to hone skills and to then apply them at an elite level—\nthe core activities in craft.) Deep work, therefore, is key to extracting\nmeaning from your profession in the manner described by Dreyfus and\nKelly. It follows that to embrace deep work in your own career, and to\ndirect it toward cultivating your skill, is an effort that can transform a\nknowledge work job from a distracted, draining obligation into something\nsatisfying—a portal to a world full of shining, wondrous things.\nHomo Sapiens Deepensis\nThe first two chapters of Part 1 were pragmatic. They argued that deep\nwork is becoming increasingly valuable in our economy at the same time\nthat it also is becoming increasingly rare (for somewhat arbitrary reasons).\nThis represents a classic market mismatch: If you cultivate this skill, you’ll\nthrive professionally.\nThis final chapter, by contrast, has little to add to this practical\ndiscussion of workplace advancement, and yet it’s absolutely necessary for\nthese earlier ideas to gain traction. The pages ahead describe a rigorous\nprogram for transforming your professional life into one centered on depth.\nThis is a difficult transition, and as with many such efforts, well-reasoned,\npragmatic arguments can motivate you only to a certain point. Eventually,\nthe goal you pursue needs to resonate at a more human level. This chapter\nargues that when it comes to the embrace of depth, such resonance is\ninevitable. Whether you approach the activity of going deep from the\nperspective of neuroscience, psychology, or lofty philosophy, these paths all\nseem to lead back to a connection between depth and meaning. It’s as if our\nspecies has evolved into one that flourishes in depth and wallows in\nshallowness, becoming what we might call Homo sapiens deepensis.\nI earlier quoted Winifred Gallagher, the converted disciple of depth,\nsaying, “I’ll live the focused life, because it’s the best kind there is.” This is\nperhaps the best way to sum up the argument of this chapter and of Part 1\nmore broadly: A deep life is a good life, any way you look at it.\nPART 2\nThe Rules\nRule #1\nWork Deeply\nSoon after I met David Dewane for a drink at a Dupont Circle bar, he\nbrought up the Eudaimonia Machine. Dewane is an architecture professor,\nand therefore likes to explore the intersection between the conceptual and\nthe concrete. The Eudaimonia Machine is a good example of this\nintersection. The machine, which takes its name from the ancient Greek\nconcept of eudaimonia (a state in which you’re achieving your full human\npotential), turns out to be a building. “The goal of the machine,” David\nexplained, “is to create a setting where the users can get into a state of deep\nhuman flourishing—creating work that’s at the absolute extent of their\npersonal abilities.” It is, in other words, a space designed for the sole\npurpose of enabling the deepest possible deep work. I was, as you might\nexpect, intrigued.\nAs Dewane explained the machine to me, he grabbed a pen to sketch its\nproposed layout. The structure is a one-story narrow rectangle made up of\nfive rooms, placed in a line, one after another. There’s no shared hallway:\nyou have to pass through one room to get to the next. As Dewane explains,\n“[The lack of circulation] is critical because it doesn’t allow you to bypass\nany of the spaces as you get deeper into the machine.”\nThe first room you enter when coming off the street is called the gallery.\nIn Dewane’s plan, this room would contain examples of deep work\nproduced in the building. It’s meant to inspire users of the machine, creating\na “culture of healthy stress and peer pressure.”\nAs you leave the gallery, you next enter the salon. In here, Dewane\nimagines access to high-quality coffee and perhaps even a full bar. There\nare also couches and Wi-Fi. The salon is designed to create a mood that\n“hovers between intense curiosity and argumentation.” This is a place to\ndebate, “brood,” and in general work through the ideas that you’ll develop\ndeeper in the machine.\nBeyond the salon you enter the library. This room stores a permanent\nrecord of all work produced in the machine, as well as the books and other\nresources used in this previous work. There will be copiers and scanners for\ngathering and collecting the information you need for your project. Dewane\ndescribes the library as “the hard drive of the machine.”\nThe next room is the office space. It contains a standard conference\nroom with a whiteboard and some cubicles with desks. “The office,”\nDewane explains, “is for low-intensity activity.” To use our terminology,\nthis is the space to complete the shallow efforts required by your project.\nDewane imagines an administrator with a desk in the office who could help\nits users improve their work habits to optimize their efficiency.\nThis brings us to the final room of the machine, a collection of what\nDewane calls “deep work chambers” (he adopted the term “deep work”\nfrom my articles on the topic). Each chamber is conceived to be six by ten\nfeet and protected by thick soundproof walls (Dewane’s plans call for\neighteen inches of insulation). “The purpose of the deep work chamber is to\nallow for total focus and uninterrupted work flow,” Dewane explains. He\nimagines a process in which you spend ninety minutes inside, take a ninety-\nminute break, and repeat two or three times—at which point your brain will\nhave achieved its limit of concentration for the day.\nFor now, the Eudaimonia Machine exists only as a collection of\narchitectural drawings, but even as a plan, its potential to support impactful\nwork excites Dewane. “[This design] remains, in my mind, the most\ninteresting piece of architecture I’ve ever produced,” he told me.\nIn an ideal world—one in which the true value of deep work is accepted\nand celebrated—we’d all have access to something like the Eudaimonia\nMachine. Perhaps not David Dewane’s exact design, but, more generally\nspeaking, a work environment (and culture) designed to help us extract as\nmuch value as possible from our brains. Unfortunately, this vision is far\nfrom our current reality. We instead find ourselves in distracting open\noffices where inboxes cannot be neglected and meetings are incessant—a\nsetting where colleagues would rather you respond quickly to their latest e-\nmail than produce the best possible results. As a reader of this book, in\nother words, you’re a disciple of depth in a shallow world.\nThis rule—the first of four such rules in Part 2 of this book—is designed\nto reduce this conflict. You might not have access to your own Eudaimonia\nMachine, but the strategies that follow will help you simulate its effects in\nyour otherwise distracted professional life. They’ll show you how to\ntransform deep work from an aspiration into a regular and significant part\nof your daily schedule. (Rules #2 through #4 will then help you get the most\nout of this deep work habit by presenting, among other things, strategies for\ntraining your concentration ability and fighting back encroaching\ndistractions.)\nBefore proceeding to these strategies, however, I want to first address a\nquestion that might be nagging you: Why do we need such involved\ninterventions? Put another way, once you accept that deep work is valuable,\nisn’t it enough to just start doing more of it? Do we really need something\nas complicated as the Eudaimonia Machine (or its equivalent) for\nsomething as simple as remembering to concentrate more often?\nUnfortunately, when it comes to replacing distraction with focus, matters\nare not so simple. To understand why this is true let’s take a closer look at\none of the main obstacles to going deep: the urge to turn your attention\ntoward something more superficial. Most people recognize that this urge\ncan complicate efforts to concentrate on hard things, but most\nunderestimate its regularity and strength.\nConsider a 2012 study, led by psychologists Wilhelm Hofmann and Roy\nBaumeister, that outfitted 205 adults with beepers that activated at randomly\nselected times (this is the experience sampling method discussed in Part 1).\nWhen the beeper sounded, the subject was asked to pause for a moment to\nreflect on desires that he or she was currently feeling or had felt in the last\nthirty minutes, and then answer a set of questions about these desires. After\na week, the researchers had gathered more than 7,500 samples. Here’s the\nshort version of what they found: People fight desires all day long. As\nBaumeister summarized in his subsequent book, Willpower (co-authored\nwith the science writer John Tierney): “Desire turned out to be the norm,\nnot the exception.”\nThe five most common desires these subjects fought include, not\nsurprisingly, eating, sleeping, and sex. But the top five list also included\ndesires for “taking a break from [hard] work… checking e-mail and social\nnetworking sites, surfing the web, listening to music, or watching\ntelevision.” The lure of the Internet and television proved especially strong:\nThe subjects succeeded in resisting these particularly addictive distractions\nonly around half the time.\nThese results are bad news for this rule’s goal of helping you cultivate a\ndeep work habit. They tell us that you can expect to be bombarded with the\ndesire to do anything but work deeply throughout the day, and if you’re like\nthe German subjects from the Hofmann and Baumeister study, these\ncompeting desires will often win out. You might respond at this point that\nyou will succeed where these subjects failed because you understand the\nimportance of depth and will therefore be more rigorous in your will to\nremain concentrated. This is a noble sentiment, but the decades of research\nthat preceded this study underscore its futility. A now voluminous line of\ninquiry, initiated in a series of pioneering papers also written by Roy\nBaumeister, has established the following important (and at the time,\nunexpected) truth about willpower: You have a finite amount of willpower\nthat becomes depleted as you use it.\nYour will, in other words, is not a manifestation of your character that\nyou can deploy without limit; it’s instead like a muscle that tires. This is\nwhy the subjects in the Hofmann and Baumeister study had such a hard\ntime fighting desires—over time these distractions drained their finite pool\nof willpower until they could no longer resist. The same will happen to you,\nregardless of your intentions—unless, that is, you’re smart about your\nhabits.\nThis brings me to the motivating idea behind the strategies that follow:\nThe key to developing a deep work habit is to move beyond good intentions\nand add routines and rituals to your working life designed to minimize the\namount of your limited willpower necessary to transition into and maintain\na state of unbroken concentration. If you suddenly decide, for example, in\nthe middle of a distracted afternoon spent Web browsing, to switch your\nattention to a cognitively demanding task, you’ll draw heavily from your\nfinite willpower to wrest your attention away from the online shininess.\nSuch attempts will therefore frequently fail. On the other hand, if you\ndeployed smart routines and rituals—perhaps a set time and quiet location\nused for your deep tasks each afternoon—you’d require much less\nwillpower to start and keep going. In the long run, you’d therefore succeed\nwith these deep efforts far more often.\nWith this in mind, the six strategies that follow can be understood as an\narsenal of routines and rituals designed with the science of limited\nwillpower in mind to maximize the amount of deep work you consistently\naccomplish in your schedule. Among other things, they’ll ask you to\ncommit to a particular pattern for scheduling this work and develop rituals\nto sharpen your concentration before starting each session. Some of these\nstrategies will deploy simple heuristics to hijack your brain’s motivation\ncenter while others are designed to recharge your willpower reserves at the\nfastest possible rate.\nYou could just try to make deep work a priority. But supporting this\ndecision with the strategies that follow—or strategies of your own devising\nthat are motivated by the same principles—will significantly increase the\nprobability that you succeed in making deep work a crucial part of your\nprofessional life.\nDecide on Your Depth Philosophy\nThe famed computer scientist Donald Knuth cares about deep work. As he\nexplains on his website: “What I do takes long hours of studying and\nuninterruptible concentration.” A doctoral candidate named Brian Chappell,\nwho is a father with a full-time job, also values deep work, as it’s the only\nway he can make progress on his dissertation given his limited time.\nChappell told me that his first encounter with the idea of deep work was “an\nemotional moment.”\nI mention these examples because although Knuth and Chappell agree\non the importance of depth, they disagree on their philosophies for\nintegrating this depth into their work lives. As I’ll detail in the next section,\nKnuth deploys a form of monasticism that prioritizes deep work by trying\nto eliminate or minimize all other types of work. Chappell, by contrast,\ndeploys a rhythmic strategy in which he works for the same hours (five to\nseven thirty a.m.) every weekday morning, without exception, before\nbeginning a workday punctuated by standard distractions. Both approaches\nwork, but not universally. Knuth’s approach might make sense for someone\nwhose primary professional obligation is to think big thoughts, but if\nChappell adopted a similar rejection of all things shallow, he’d likely lose\nhis job.\nYou need your own philosophy for integrating deep work into your\nprofessional life. (As argued in this rule’s introduction, attempting to\nschedule deep work in an ad hoc fashion is not an effective way to manage\nyour limited willpower.) But this example highlights a general warning\nabout this selection: You must be careful to choose a philosophy that fits\nyour specific circumstances, as a mismatch here can derail your deep work\nhabit before it has a chance to solidify. This strategy will help you avoid\nthis fate by presenting four different depth philosophies that I’ve seen work\nexceptionally well in practice. The goal is to convince you that there are\nmany different ways to integrate deep work into your schedule, and it’s\ntherefore worth taking the time to find an approach that makes sense for\nyou.\nThe Monastic Philosophy of Deep Work Scheduling\nLet’s return to Donald Knuth. He’s famous for many innovations in\ncomputer science, including, notably, the development of a rigorous\napproach to analyzing algorithm performance. Among his peers, however,\nKnuth also maintains an aura of infamy for his approach to electronic\ncommunication. If you visit Knuth’s website at Stanford with the intention\nof finding his e-mail address, you’ll instead discover the following note:\nI have been a happy man ever since January 1, 1990, when I no\nlonger had an email address. I’d used email since about 1975, and it\nseems to me that 15 years of email is plenty for one lifetime. Email is\na wonderful thing for people whose role in life is to be on top of\nthings. But not for me; my role is to be on the bottom of things. What\nI do takes long hours of studying and uninterruptible concentration.\nKnuth goes on to acknowledge that he doesn’t intend to cut himself off\ncompletely from the world. He notes that writing his books requires\ncommunication with thousands of people and that he wants to be responsive\nto questions and comments. His solution? He provides an address—a postal\nmailing address. He says that his administrative assistant will sort through\nany letters arriving at that address and put aside those that she thinks are\nrelevant. Anything that’s truly urgent she’ll bring to Knuth promptly, and\neverything else he’ll handle in a big batch, once every three months or so.\nKnuth deploys what I call the monastic philosophy of deep work\nscheduling. This philosophy attempts to maximize deep efforts by\neliminating or radically minimizing shallow obligations. Practitioners of the\nmonastic philosophy tend to have a well-defined and highly valued\nprofessional goal that they’re pursuing, and the bulk of their professional\nsuccess comes from doing this one thing exceptionally well. It’s this clarity\nthat helps them eliminate the thicket of shallow concerns that tend to trip up\nthose whose value proposition in the working world is more varied.\nKnuth, for example, explains his professional goal as follows: “I try to\nlearn certain areas of computer science exhaustively; then I try to digest that\nknowledge into a form that is accessible to people who don’t have time for\nsuch study.” Trying to pitch Knuth on the intangible returns of building an\naudience on Twitter, or the unexpected opportunities that might come\nthrough a more liberal use of e-mail, will fail, as these behaviors don’t\ndirectly aid his goal to exhaustively understand specific corners of\ncomputer science and then write about them in an accessible manner.\nAnother person committed to monastic deep work is the acclaimed\nscience fiction writer Neal Stephenson. If you visit Stephenson’s author\nwebsite, you’ll notice a lack of e-mail or mailing address. We can gain\ninsight into this omission from a pair of essays that Stephenson posted on\nhis early website (hosted on The Well) back in the early 2000s, and which\nhave been preserved by the Internet Archive. In one such essay, archived in\n2003, Stephenson summarizes his communication policy as follows:\nPersons who wish to interfere with my concentration are politely\nrequested not to do so, and warned that I don’t answer e-mail… lest\n[my communication policy’s] key message get lost in the verbiage, I\nwill put it here succinctly: All of my time and attention are spoken for\n—several times over. Please do not ask for them.\nTo further justify this policy, Stephenson wrote an essay titled “Why I\nAm a Bad Correspondent.” At the core of his explanation for his\ninaccessibility is the following decision:\nThe productivity equation is a non-linear one, in other words. This\naccounts for why I am a bad correspondent and why I very rarely\naccept speaking engagements. If I organize my life in such a way that\nI get lots of long, consecutive, uninterrupted time-chunks, I can write\nnovels. But as those chunks get separated and fragmented, my\nproductivity as a novelist drops spectacularly.\nStephenson sees two mutually exclusive options: He can write good\nnovels at a regular rate, or he can answer a lot of individual e-mails and\nattend conferences, and as a result produce lower-quality novels at a slower\nrate. He chose the former option, and this choice requires him to avoid as\nmuch as possible any source of shallow work in his professional life. (This\nissue is so important to Stephenson that he went on to explore its\nimplications—positive and negative—in his 2008 science fiction epic,\nAnathem, which considers a world where an intellectual elite live in\nmonastic orders, isolated from the distracted masses and technology,\nthinking deep thoughts.)\nIn my experience, the monastic philosophy makes many knowledge\nworkers defensive. The clarity with which its adherents identify their value\nto the world, I suspect, touches a raw nerve for those whose contribution to\nthe information economy is more complex. Notice, of course, that “more\ncomplex” does not mean “lesser.” A high-level manager, for example,\nmight play a vital role in the functioning of a billion-dollar company, even\nif she cannot point to something discrete, like a completed novel, and say,\n“This is what I produced this year.” Therefore, the pool of individuals to\nwhom the monastic philosophy applies is limited—and that’s okay. If\nyou’re outside this pool, its radical simplicity shouldn’t evince too much\nenvy. On the other hand, if you’re inside this pool—someone whose\ncontribution to the world is discrete, clear, and individualized*—then you\nshould give this philosophy serious consideration, as it might be the\ndeciding factor between an average career and one that will be remembered.\nThe Bimodal Philosophy of Deep Work Scheduling\nThis book opened with a story about the revolutionary psychologist and\nthinker Carl Jung. In the 1920s, at the same time that Jung was attempting\nto break away from the strictures of his mentor, Sigmund Freud, he began\nregular retreats to a rustic stone house he built in the woods outside the\nsmall town of Bollingen. When there, Jung would lock himself every\nmorning into a minimally appointed room to write without interruption. He\nwould then meditate and walk in the woods to clarify his thinking in\npreparation for the next day’s writing. These efforts, I argued, were aimed at\nincreasing the intensity of Jung’s deep work to a level that would allow him\nto succeed in intellectual combat with Freud and his many supporters.\nIn recalling this story I want to emphasize something important: Jung\ndid not deploy a monastic approach to deep work. Donald Knuth and Neal\nStephenson, our examples from earlier, attempted to completely eliminate\ndistraction and shallowness from their professional lives. Jung, by contrast,\nsought this elimination only during the periods he spent at his retreat. The\nrest of Jung’s time was spent in Zurich, where his life was anything but\nmonastic: He ran a busy clinical practice that often had him seeing patients\nuntil late at night; he was an active participant in the Zurich coffeehouse\nculture; and he gave and attended many lectures in the city’s respected\nuniversities. (Einstein received his doctorate from one university in Zurich\nand later taught at another; he also, interestingly enough, knew Jung, and\nthe two shared several dinners to discuss the key ideas of Einstein’s special\nrelativity.) Jung’s life in Zurich, in other words, is similar in many ways to\nthe modern archetype of the hyperconnected digital-age knowledge worker:\nReplace “Zurich” with “San Francisco” and “letter” with “tweet” and we\ncould be discussing some hotshot tech CEO.\nJung’s approach is what I call the bimodal philosophy of deep work.\nThis philosophy asks that you divide your time, dedicating some clearly\ndefined stretches to deep pursuits and leaving the rest open to everything\nelse. During the deep time, the bimodal worker will act monastically—\nseeking intense and uninterrupted concentration. During the shallow time,\nsuch focus is not prioritized. This division of time between deep and open\ncan happen on multiple scales. For example, on the scale of a week, you\nmight dedicate a four-day weekend to depth and the rest to open time.\nSimilarly, on the scale of a year, you might dedicate one season to contain\nmost of your deep stretches (as many academics do over the summer or\nwhile on sabbatical).\nThe bimodal philosophy believes that deep work can produce extreme\nproductivity, but only if the subject dedicates enough time to such\nendeavors to reach maximum cognitive intensity—the state in which real\nbreakthroughs occur. This is why the minimum unit of time for deep work\nin this philosophy tends to be at least one full day. To put aside a few hours\nin the morning, for example, is too short to count as a deep work stretch for\nan adherent of this approach.\nAt the same time, the bimodal philosophy is typically deployed by\npeople who cannot succeed in the absence of substantial commitments to\nnon-deep pursuits. Jung, for example, needed his clinical practice to pay the\nbills and the Zurich coffeehouse scene to stimulate his thinking. The\napproach of shifting between two modes provides a way to serve both needs\nwell.\nTo provide a more modern example of the bimodal philosophy in action,\nwe can once again consider Adam Grant, the Wharton Business School\nprofessor whose thoughtfulness about work habits was first introduced in\nPart 1. As you might recall, Grant’s schedule during his rapid rise through\nthe professorship ranks at Wharton provides a nice bimodality case study.\nOn the scale of the academic year, he stacked his courses into one semester,\nso that he could focus the other on deep work. During these deep semesters\nhe then applied the bimodal approach on the weekly scale. He would,\nperhaps once or twice a month, take a period of two to four days to become\ncompletely monastic. He would shut his door, put an out-of-office auto-\nresponder on his e-mail, and work on his research without interruption.\nOutside of these deep sessions, Grant remained famously open and\naccessible. In some sense, he had to be: His 2013 bestseller, Give and Take,\npromotes the practice of giving of your time and attention, without\nexpectation of something in return, as a key strategy in professional\nadvancement.\nThose who deploy the bimodal philosophy of deep work admire the\nproductivity of the monastics but also respect the value they receive from\nthe shallow behaviors in their working lives. Perhaps the biggest obstacle to\nimplementing this philosophy is that even short periods of deep work\nrequire a flexibility that many fear they lack in their current positions. If\neven an hour away from your inbox makes you uncomfortable, then\ncertainly the idea of disappearing for a day or more at a time will seem\nimpossible. But I suspect bimodal working is compatible with more types\nof jobs than you might guess. Earlier, for example, I described a study by\nHarvard Business School professor Leslie Perlow. In this study, a group of\nmanagement consultants were asked to disconnect for a full day each\nworkweek. The consultants were afraid the client would rebel. It turned out\nthat the client didn’t care. As Jung, Grant, and Perlow’s subjects discovered,\npeople will usually respect your right to become inaccessible if these\nperiods are well defined and well advertised, and outside these stretches,\nyou’re once again easy to find.\nThe Rhythmic Philosophy of Deep Work Scheduling\nIn the early days of the Seinfeld show, Jerry Seinfeld remained a working\ncomic with a busy tour schedule. It was during this period that a writer and\ncomic named Brad Isaac, who was working open mic nights at the time, ran\ninto Seinfeld at a club waiting to go on stage. As Isaac later explained in a\nnow classic Lifehacker article: “I saw my chance. I had to ask Seinfeld if he\nhad any tips for a young comic. What he told me was something that would\nbenefit me for a lifetime.”\nSeinfeld began his advice to Isaac with some common sense, noting “the\nway to be a better comic was to create better jokes,” and then explaining\nthat the way to create better jokes was to write every day. Seinfeld\ncontinued by describing a specific technique he used to help maintain this\ndiscipline. He keeps a calendar on his wall. Every day that he writes jokes\nhe crosses out the date on the calendar with a big red X. “After a few days\nyou’ll have a chain,” Seinfeld said. “Just keep at it and the chain will grow\nlonger every day. You’ll like seeing that chain, especially when you get a\nfew weeks under your belt. Your only job next is to not break the chain.”\nThis chain method (as some now call it) soon became a hit among\nwriters and fitness enthusiasts—communities that thrive on the ability to do\nhard things consistently. For our purposes, it provides a specific example of\na general approach to integrating depth into your life: the rhythmic\nphilosophy. This philosophy argues that the easiest way to consistently start\ndeep work sessions is to transform them into a simple regular habit. The\ngoal, in other words, is to generate a rhythm for this work that removes the\nneed for you to invest energy in deciding if and when you’re going to go\ndeep. The chain method is a good example of the rhythmic philosophy of\ndeep work scheduling because it combines a simple scheduling heuristic\n(do the work every day), with an easy way to remind yourself to do the\nwork: the big red Xs on the calendar.\nAnother common way to implement the rhythmic philosophy is to\nreplace the visual aid of the chain method with a set starting time that you\nuse every day for deep work. In much the same way that maintaining visual\nindicators of your work progress can reduce the barrier to entry for going\ndeep, eliminating even the simplest scheduling decisions, such as when\nduring the day to do the work, also reduces this barrier.\nConsider the example of Brian Chappell, the busy doctoral candidate I\nintroduced in the opening to this strategy. Chappell adopted the rhythmic\nphilosophy of deep work scheduling out of necessity. Around the time that\nhe was ramping up his dissertation writing he was offered a full-time job at\na center on the campus where he was a student. Professionally, this was a\ngood opportunity and Chappell was happy to accept it. But academically, a\nfull-time job, especially when coupled with the recent arrival of Chappell’s\nfirst child, made it difficult to find the depth needed to write thesis chapters.\nChappell began by attempting a vague commitment to deep work. He\nmade a rule that deep work needed to happen in ninety-minute chunks\n(recognizing correctly that it takes time to ease into a state of concentration)\nand he decided he would try to schedule these chunks in an ad hoc manner\nwhenever appropriate openings in his schedule arose. Not surprisingly, this\nstrategy didn’t yield much productivity. In a dissertation boot camp\nChappell had attended the year before, he’d managed to produce a full\nthesis chapter in a single week of rigorous deep work. After he accepted his\nfull-time job, he managed to produce only a single additional chapter in the\nentire first year he was working.\nIt was the glacial writing progress during this year that drove Chappell\nto embrace the rhythmic method. He made a rule that he would wake up\nand start working by five thirty every morning. He would then work until\nseven thirty, make breakfast, and go to work already done with his\ndissertation obligations for the day. Pleased by early progress, he soon\npushed his wake-up time to four forty-five to squeeze out even more\nmorning depth.\nWhen I interviewed Chappell for this book, he described his rhythmic\napproach to deep work scheduling as “both astronomically productive and\nguilt free.” His routine was producing four to five pages of academic prose\nper day and was capable of generating drafts of thesis chapters at a rate of\none chapter every two or three weeks: a phenomenal output for someone\nwho also worked a nine-to-five job. “Who’s to say that I can’t be that\nprolific?” he concluded. “Why not me?”\nThe rhythmic philosophy provides an interesting contrast to the bimodal\nphilosophy. It perhaps fails to achieve the most intense levels of deep\nthinking sought in the daylong concentration sessions favored by the\nbimodalist. The trade-off, however, is that this approach works better with\nthe reality of human nature. By supporting deep work with rock-solid\nroutines that make sure a little bit gets done on a regular basis, the rhythmic\nscheduler will often log a larger total number of deep hours per year.\nThe decision between rhythmic and bimodal can come down to your\nself-control in such scheduling matters. If you’re Carl Jung and are engaged\nin an intellectual dogfight with Sigmund Freud’s supporters, you’ll likely\nhave no trouble recognizing the importance of finding time to focus on your\nideas. On the other hand, if you’re writing a dissertation with no one\npressuring you to get it done, the habitual nature of the rhythmic philosophy\nmight be necessary to maintain progress.\nFor many, however, it’s not just self-control issues that bias them toward\nthe rhythmic philosophy, but also the reality that some jobs don’t allow you\nto disappear for days at a time when the need to go deep arises. (For a lot of\nbosses, the standard is that you’re free to focus as hard as you want… so\nlong as the boss’s e-mails are still answered promptly.) This is likely the\nbiggest reason why the rhythmic philosophy is one of the most common\namong deep workers in standard office jobs.\nThe Journalistic Philosophy of Deep Work Scheduling\nIn the 1980s, the journalist Walter Isaacson was in his thirties and well\nalong in his rapid ascent through the ranks of Time magazine. By this point,\nhe was undoubtedly on the radar of the thinking class. Christopher\nHitchens, for example, writing in the London Review of Books during this\nperiod, called him “one of the best magazine journalists in America.” The\ntime was right for Isaacson to write a Big Important Book—a necessary\nstep on the ladder of journalistic achievement. So Isaacson chose a\ncomplicated topic, an intertwined narrative biography of six figures who\nplayed an important role in early Cold War policy, and teamed up with a\nfellow young Time editor, Evan Thomas, to produce an appropriately\nweighty book: an 864-page epic titled The Wise Men: Six Friends and the\nWorld They Made.\nThis book, which was published in 1986, was well received by the right\npeople. The New York Times called it “a richly textured account,” while the\nSan Francisco Chronicle exulted that the two young writers had “fashioned\na Cold War Plutarch.” Less than a decade later, Isaacson reached the apex\nof his journalism career when he was appointed editor of Time (which he\nthen followed with a second act as the CEO of a think tank and an\nincredibly popular biographer of figures including Benjamin Franklin,\nAlbert Einstein, and Steve Jobs).\nWhat interests me about Isaacson, however, is not what he accomplished\nwith his first book but how he wrote it. In uncovering this story, I must draw\nfrom a fortunate personal connection. As it turns out, in the years leading up\nto the publication of The Wise Men, my uncle John Paul Newport, who was\nalso a journalist in New York at the time, shared a summer beach rental\nwith Isaacson. To this day, my uncle remembers Isaacson’s impressive work\nhabits:\nIt was always amazing… he could retreat up to the bedroom for a\nwhile, when the rest of us were chilling on the patio or whatever, to\nwork on his book… he’d go up for twenty minutes or an hour, we’d\nhear the typewriter pounding, then he’d come down as relaxed as the\nrest of us… the work never seemed to faze him, he just happily went\nup to work when he had the spare time.\nIsaacson was methodic: Any time he could find some free time, he\nwould switch into a deep work mode and hammer away at his book. This is\nhow, it turns out, one can write a nine-hundred-page book on the side while\nspending the bulk of one’s day becoming one of the country’s best\nmagazine writers.\nI call this approach, in which you fit deep work wherever you can into\nyour schedule, the journalist philosophy. This name is a nod to the fact that\njournalists, like Walter Isaacson, are trained to shift into a writing mode on\na moment’s notice, as is required by the deadline-driven nature of their\nprofession.\nThis approach is not for the deep work novice. As I established in the\nopening to this rule, the ability to rapidly switch your mind from shallow to\ndeep mode doesn’t come naturally. Without practice, such switches can\nseriously deplete your finite willpower reserves. This habit also requires a\nsense of confidence in your abilities—a conviction that what you’re doing\nis important and will succeed. This type of conviction is typically built on a\nfoundation of existing professional accomplishment. Isaacson, for example,\nlikely had an easier time switching to writing mode than, say, a first-time\nnovelist, because Isaacson had worked himself up to become a respected\nwriter by this point. He knew he had the capacity to write an epic biography\nand understood it to be a key task in his professional advancement. This\nconfidence goes a long way in motivating hard efforts.\nI’m partial to the journalistic philosophy of deep work because it’s my\nmain approach to integrating these efforts into my schedule. In other words,\nI’m not monastic in my deep work (though I do find myself occasionally\njealous of my fellow computer scientist Donald Knuth’s unapologetic\ndisconnection), I don’t deploy multiday depth binges like the bimodalists,\nand though I am intrigued by the rhythmic philosophy, my schedule has a\nway of thwarting attempts to enforce a daily habit. Instead, in an ode to\nIsaacson, I face each week as it arrives and do my best to squeeze out as\nmuch depth as possible. To write this book, for example, I had to take\nadvantage of free stretches of time wherever they popped up. If my kids\nwere taking a good nap, I’d grab my laptop and lock myself in the home\noffice. If my wife wanted to visit her parents in nearby Annapolis on a\nweekend day, I’d take advantage of the extra child care to disappear to a\nquiet corner of their house to write. If a meeting at work was canceled, or\nan afternoon left open, I might retreat to one of my favorite libraries on\ncampus to squeeze out a few hundred more words. And so on.\nI should admit that I’m not pure in my application of the journalist\nphilosophy. I don’t, for example, make all my deep work decisions on a\nmoment-to-moment basis. I instead tend to map out when I’ll work deeply\nduring each week at the beginning of the week, and then refine these\ndecisions, as needed, at the beginning of each day (see Rule #4 for more\ndetails on my scheduling routines). By reducing the need to make decisions\nabout deep work moment by moment, I can preserve more mental energy\nfor the deep thinking itself.\nIn the final accounting, the journalistic philosophy of deep work\nscheduling remains difficult to pull off. But if you’re confident in the value\nof what you’re trying to produce, and practiced in the skill of going deep (a\nskill we will continue to develop in the strategies that follow), it can be a\nsurprisingly robust way to squeeze out large amounts of depth from an\notherwise demanding schedule.\nRitualize\nAn often-overlooked observation about those who use their minds to create\nvaluable things is that they’re rarely haphazard in their work habits.\nConsider the Pulitzer Prize–winning biographer Robert Caro. As revealed\nin a 2009 magazine profile, “every inch of [Caro’s] New York office is\ngoverned by rules.” Where he places his books, how he stacks his\nnotebooks, what he puts on his wall, even what he wears to the office:\nEverything is specified by a routine that has varied little over Caro’s long\ncareer. “I trained myself to be organized,” he explained.\nCharles Darwin had a similarly strict structure for his working life\nduring the period when he was perfecting On the Origin of Species. As his\nson Francis later remembered, he would rise promptly at seven to take a\nshort walk. He would then eat breakfast alone and retire to his study from\neight to nine thirty. The next hour was dedicated to reading his letters from\nthe day before, after which he would return to his study from ten thirty until\nnoon. After this session, he would mull over challenging ideas while\nwalking on a proscribed route that started at his greenhouse and then circled\na path on his property. He would walk until satisfied with his thinking then\ndeclare his workday done.\nThe journalist Mason Currey, who spent half a decade cataloging the\nhabits of famous thinkers and writers (and from whom I learned the\nprevious two examples), summarized this tendency toward systematization\nas follows:\nThere is a popular notion that artists work from inspiration—that\nthere is some strike or bolt or bubbling up of creative mojo from who\nknows where… but I hope [my work] makes clear that waiting for\ninspiration to strike is a terrible, terrible plan. In fact, perhaps the\nsingle best piece of advice I can offer to anyone trying to do creative\nwork is to ignore inspiration.\nIn a New York Times column on the topic, David Brooks summarizes\nthis reality more bluntly: “[Great creative minds] think like artists but work\nlike accountants.”\nThis strategy suggests the following: To make the most out of your deep\nwork sessions, build rituals of the same level of strictness and idiosyncrasy\nas the important thinkers mentioned previously. There’s a good reason for\nthis mimicry. Great minds like Caro and Darwin didn’t deploy rituals to be\nweird; they did so because success in their work depended on their ability to\ngo deep, again and again—there’s no way to win a Pulitzer Prize or\nconceive a grand theory without pushing your brain to its limit. Their rituals\nminimized the friction in this transition to depth, allowing them to go deep\nmore easily and stay in the state longer. If they had instead waited for\ninspiration to strike before settling in to serious work, their\naccomplishments would likely have been greatly reduced.\nThere’s no one correct deep work ritual—the right fit depends on both\nthe person and the type of project pursued. But there are some general\nquestions that any effective ritual must address:\n• Where you’ll work and for how long. Your ritual needs to specify a\nlocation for your deep work efforts. This location can be as simple as your\nnormal office with the door shut and desk cleaned off (a colleague of mine\nlikes to put a hotel-style “do not disturb” sign on his office door when he’s\ntackling something difficult). If it’s possible to identify a location used only\nfor depth—for instance, a conference room or quiet library—the positive\neffect can be even greater. (If you work in an open office plan, this need to\nfind a deep work retreat becomes particularly important.) Regardless of\nwhere you work, be sure to also give yourself a specific time frame to keep\nthe session a discrete challenge and not an open-ended slog.\n• How you’ll work once you start to work. Your ritual needs rules and\nprocesses to keep your efforts structured. For example, you might institute a\nban on any Internet use, or maintain a metric such as words produced per\ntwenty-minute interval to keep your concentration honed. Without this\nstructure, you’ll have to mentally litigate again and again what you should\nand should not be doing during these sessions and keep trying to assess\nwhether you’re working sufficiently hard. These are unnecessary drains on\nyour willpower reserves.\n• How you’ll support your work. Your ritual needs to ensure your\nbrain gets the support it needs to keep operating at a high level of depth. For\nexample, the ritual might specify that you start with a cup of good coffee, or\nmake sure you have access to enough food of the right type to maintain\nenergy, or integrate light exercise such as walking to help keep the mind\nclear. (As Nietzsche said: “It is only ideas gained from walking that have\nany worth.”) This support might also include environmental factors, such as\norganizing the raw materials of your work to minimize energy-dissipating\nfriction (as we saw with Caro’s example). To maximize your success, you\nneed to support your efforts to go deep. At the same time, this support needs\nto be systematized so that you don’t waste mental energy figuring out what\nyou need in the moment.\nThese questions will help you get started in crafting your deep work\nritual. But keep in mind that finding a ritual that sticks might require\nexperimentation, so be willing to work at it. I assure you that the effort’s\nworth it: Once you’ve evolved something that feels right, the impact can be\nsignificant. To work deeply is a big deal and should not be an activity\nundertaken lightly. Surrounding such efforts with a complicated (and\nperhaps, to the outside world, quite strange) ritual accepts this reality—\nproviding your mind with the structure and commitment it needs to slip into\nthe state of focus where you can begin to create things that matter.\nMake Grand Gestures\nIn the early winter of 2007, J.K. Rowling was struggling to complete The\nDeathly Hallows, the final book in her Harry Potter series. The pressure\nwas intense, as this book bore the responsibility of tying together the six\nthat preceded it in a way that would satisfy the series’ hundreds of millions\nof fans. Rowling needed to work deeply to satisfy these demands, but she\nwas finding unbroken concentration increasingly difficult to achieve at her\nhome office in Edinburgh, Scotland. “As I was finishing Deathly Hallows\nthere came a day where the window cleaner came, the kids were at home,\nthe dogs were barking,” Rowling recalled in an interview. It was too much,\nso J.K. Rowling decided to do something extreme to shift her mind-set\nwhere it needed to be: She checked into a suite in the five-star Balmoral\nHotel, located in the heart of downtown Edinburgh. “So I came to this hotel\nbecause it’s a beautiful hotel, but I didn’t intend to stay here,” she\nexplained. “[But] the first day’s writing went well so I kept coming back…\nand I ended up finishing the last of the Harry Potter books [here].”\nIn retrospect, it’s not surprising that Rowling ended up staying. The\nsetting was perfect for her project. The Balmoral, known as one of\nScotland’s most luxurious hotels, is a classic Victorian building complete\nwith ornate stonework and a tall clock tower. It’s also located only a couple\nof blocks away from Edinburgh Castle—one of Rowling’s inspirations in\ndreaming up Hogwarts.\nRowling’s decision to check into a luxurious hotel suite near Edinburgh\nCastle is an example of a curious but effective strategy in the world of deep\nwork: the grand gesture. The concept is simple: By leveraging a radical\nchange to your normal environment, coupled perhaps with a significant\ninvestment of effort or money, all dedicated toward supporting a deep work\ntask, you increase the perceived importance of the task. This boost in\nimportance reduces your mind’s instinct to procrastinate and delivers an\ninjection of motivation and energy.\nWriting a chapter of a Harry Potter novel, for example, is hard work and\nwill require a lot of mental energy—regardless of where you do it. But\nwhen paying more than $1,000 a day to write the chapter in a suite of an old\nhotel down the street from a Hogwarts-style castle, mustering the energy to\nbegin and sustain this work is easier than if you were instead in a distracting\nhome office.\nWhen you study the habits of other well-known deep workers, the grand\ngesture strategy comes up often. Bill Gates, for example, was famous\nduring his time as Microsoft CEO for taking Think Weeks during which he\nwould leave behind his normal work and family obligations to retreat to a\ncabin with a stack of papers and books. His goal was to think deeply,\nwithout distraction, about the big issues relevant to his company. It was\nduring one of these weeks, for example, that he famously came to the\nconclusion that the Internet was going to be a major force in the industry.\nThere was nothing physically stopping Gates from thinking deeply in his\noffice in Microsoft’s Seattle headquarters, but the novelty of his weeklong\nretreat helped him achieve the desired levels of concentration.\nThe MIT physicist and award-winning novelist Alan Lightman also\nleverages grand gestures. In his case, he retreats each summer to a “tiny\nisland” in Maine to think deeply and recharge. At least as of 2000, when he\ndescribed this gesture in an interview, the island not only lacked Internet,\nbut didn’t even have phone service. As he then justified: “It’s really about\ntwo and a half months that I’ll feel like I can recover some silence in my\nlife… which is so hard to find.”\nNot everyone has the freedom to spend two months in Maine, but many\nwriters, including Dan Pink and Michael Pollan, simulate the experience\nyear-round by building—often at significant expense and effort—writing\ncabins on their properties. (Pollan, for his part, even wrote a book about his\nexperience building his cabin in the woods behind his former Connecticut\nhome.) These outbuildings aren’t strictly necessary for these writers, who\nneed only a laptop and a flat surface to put it on to ply their trade. But it’s\nnot the amenities of the cabins that generate their value; it’s instead the\ngrand gesture represented in the design and building of the cabin for the\nsole purpose of enabling better writing.\nNot every grand gesture need be so permanent. After the pathologically\ncompetitive Bell Labs physicist William Shockley was scooped in the\ninvention of the transistor—as I detail in the next strategy, two members of\nhis team made the breakthrough at a time when Shockley was away\nworking on another project—he locked himself in a hotel room in Chicago,\nwhere he had traveled ostensibly to attend a conference. He didn’t emerge\nfrom the room until he had ironed out the details for a better design that had\nbeen rattling around in his mind. When he finally did leave the room, he\nairmailed his notes back to Murray Hill, New Jersey, so that a colleague\ncould paste them into his lab notebook and sign them to timestamp the\ninnovation. The junction form of the transistor that Shockley worked out in\nthis burst of depth ended up earning him a share of the Nobel Prize\nsubsequently awarded for the invention.\nAn even more extreme example of a onetime grand gesture yielding\nresults is a story involving Peter Shankman, an entrepreneur and social\nmedia pioneer. As a popular speaker, Shankman spends much of his time\nflying. He eventually realized that thirty thousand feet was an ideal\nenvironment for him to focus. As he explained in a blog post, “Locked in a\nseat with nothing in front of me, nothing to distract me, nothing to set off\nmy ‘Ooh! Shiny!’ DNA, I have nothing to do but be at one with my\nthoughts.” It was sometime after this realization that Shankman signed a\nbook contract that gave him only two weeks to finish the entire manuscript.\nMeeting this deadline would require incredible concentration. To achieve\nthis state, Shankman did something unconventional. He booked a round-trip\nbusiness-class ticket to Tokyo. He wrote during the whole flight to Japan,\ndrank an espresso in the business class lounge once he arrived in Japan,\nthen turned around and flew back, once again writing the whole way—\narriving back in the States only thirty hours after he first left with a\ncompleted manuscript now in hand. “The trip cost $4,000 and was worth\nevery penny,” he explained.\nIn all of these examples, it’s not just the change of environment or\nseeking of quiet that enables more depth. The dominant force is the\npsychology of committing so seriously to the task at hand. To put yourself\nin an exotic location to focus on a writing project, or to take a week off\nfrom work just to think, or to lock yourself in a hotel room until you\ncomplete an important invention: These gestures push your deep goal to a\nlevel of mental priority that helps unlock the needed mental resources.\nSometimes to go deep, you must first go big.\nDon’t Work Alone\nThe relationship between deep work and collaboration is tricky. It’s worth\ntaking the time to untangle, however, because properly leveraging\ncollaboration can increase the quality of deep work in your professional\nlife.\nIt’s helpful to start our discussion of this topic by taking a step back to\nconsider what at first seems to be an unresolvable conflict. In Part 1 of this\nbook I criticized Facebook for the design of its new headquarters. In\nparticular, I noted that the company’s goal to create the world’s largest open\noffice space—a giant room that will reportedly hold twenty-eight hundred\nworkers—represents an absurd attack on concentration. Both intuition and a\ngrowing body of research underscore the reality that sharing a workspace\nwith a large number of coworkers is incredibly distracting—creating an\nenvironment that thwarts attempts to think seriously. In a 2013 article\nsummarizing recent research on this topic, Bloomberg Businessweek went\nso far as to call for an end to the “tyranny of the open-plan office.”\nAnd yet, these open office designs are not embraced haphazardly. As\nMaria Konnikova reports in The New Yorker, when this concept first\nemerged, its goal was to “facilitate communication and idea flow.” This\nclaim resonated with American businesses looking to embrace an aura of\nstart-up unconventionality. Josh Tyrangiel, the editor of Bloomberg\nBusinessweek, for example, explained the lack of offices in Bloomberg’s\nheadquarters as follows: “Open plan is pretty spectacular; it ensures that\neveryone is attuned to the broad mission, and… it encourages curiosity\nbetween people who work in different disciplines.” Jack Dorsey justified\nthe open layout of the Square headquarters by explaining: “We encourage\npeople to stay out in the open because we believe in serendipity—and\npeople walking by each other teaching new things.”\nFor the sake of discussion, let’s call this principle—that when you allow\npeople to bump into each other smart collaborations and new ideas emerge\n—the theory of serendipitous creativity. When Mark Zuckerberg decided to\nbuild the world’s largest office, we can reasonably conjecture, this theory\nhelped drive his decision, just as it has driven many of the moves toward\nopen workspaces elsewhere in Silicon Valley and beyond. (Other less-\nexalted factors, like saving money and increasing supervision, also play a\nrole, but they’re not as sexy and are therefore less emphasized.)\nThis decision between promoting concentration and promoting\nserendipity seems to indicate that deep work (an individual endeavor) is\nincompatible with generating creative insights (a collaborative endeavor).\nThis conclusion, however, is flawed. It’s based, I argue, on an incomplete\nunderstanding of the theory of serendipitous creativity. To support this\nclaim, let’s consider the origins of this particular understanding of what\nspurs breakthroughs.\nThe theory in question has many sources, but I happen to have a\npersonal connection to one of the more well-known. During my seven years\nat MIT, I worked on the site of the institute’s famed Building 20. This\nstructure, located at the intersection of Main and Vassar Streets in East\nCambridge, and eventually demolished in 1998, was thrown together as a\ntemporary shelter during World War II, meant to house the overflow from\nthe school’s bustling Radiation Laboratory. As noted by a 2012 New Yorker\narticle, the building was initially seen as a failure: “Ventilation was poor\nand hallways were dim. The walls were thin, the roof leaked, and the\nbuilding was broiling in the summer and freezing in the winter.”\nWhen the war ended, however, the influx of scientists to Cambridge\ncontinued. MIT needed space, so instead of immediately demolishing\nBuilding 20 as they had promised local officials (in exchange for lax\npermitting), they continued using it as overflow space. The result was that a\nmismatch of different departments—from nuclear science to linguistics to\nelectronics—shared the low-slung building alongside more esoteric tenants\nsuch as a machine shop and a piano repair facility. Because the building\nwas cheaply constructed, these groups felt free to rearrange space as\nneeded. Walls and floors could be shifted and equipment bolted to the\nbeams. In recounting the story of Jerrold Zacharias’s work on the first\natomic clock, the abovementioned New Yorker article points to the\nimportance of his ability to remove two floors from his Building 20 lab so\nhe could install the three-story cylinder needed for his experimental\napparatus.\nIn MIT lore, it’s generally believed that this haphazard combination of\ndifferent disciplines, thrown together in a large reconfigurable building, led\nto chance encounters and a spirit of inventiveness that generated\nbreakthroughs at a fast pace, innovating topics as diverse as Chomsky\ngrammars, Loran navigational radars, and video games, all within the same\nproductive postwar decades. When the building was finally demolished to\nmake way for the $300 million Frank Gehry–designed Stata Center (where I\nspent my time), its loss was mourned. In tribute to the “plywood palace” it\nreplaced, the interior design of the Stata Center includes boards of\nunfinished plywood and exposed concrete with construction markings left\nintact.\nAround the same time that Building 20 was hastily constructed, a more\nsystematic pursuit of serendipitous creativity was under way two hundred\nmiles to the southwest in Murray Hill, New Jersey. It was here that Bell\nLabs director Mervin Kelly guided the construction of a new home for the\nlab that would purposefully encourage interaction between its diverse mix\nof scientists and engineers. Kelly dismissed the standard university-style\napproach of housing different departments in different buildings, and\ninstead connected the spaces into one contiguous structure joined by long\nhallways—some so long that when you stood at one end it would appear to\nconverge to a vanishing point. As Bell Labs chronicler Jon Gertner notes\nabout this design: “Traveling the hall’s length without encountering a\nnumber of acquaintances, problems, diversions and ideas was almost\nimpossible. A physicist on his way to lunch in the cafeteria was like a\nmagnet rolling past iron filings.”\nThis strategy, mixed with Kelly’s aggressive recruitment of some of the\nworld’s best minds, yielded some of the most concentrated innovation in the\nhistory of modern civilization. In the decades following the Second World\nWar, the lab produced, among other achievements: the first solar cell, laser,\ncommunication satellite, cellular communication system, and fiber optic\nnetworking. At the same time, their theorists formulated both information\ntheory and coding theory, their astronomers won the Nobel Prize for\nempirically validating the Big Bang Theory, and perhaps most important of\nall, their physicists invented the transistor.\nThe theory of serendipitous creativity, in other words, seems well\njustified by the historical record. The transistor, we can argue with some\nconfidence, probably required Bell Labs and its ability to put solid-state\nphysicists, quantum theorists, and world-class experimentalists in one\nbuilding where they could serendipitously encounter one another and learn\nfrom their varied expertise. This was an invention unlikely to come from a\nlone scientist thinking deeply in the academic equivalent of Carl Jung’s\nstone tower.\nBut it’s here that we must embrace more nuance in understanding what\nreally generated innovation in sites such as Building 20 and Bell Labs. To\ndo so, let’s return once again to my own experience at MIT. When I arrived\nas a new PhD student in the fall of 2004, I was a member of the first\nincoming class to be housed in the new Stata Center, which, as mentioned,\nreplaced Building 20. Because the center was new, incoming students were\ngiven tours that touted its features. Frank Gehry, we learned, arranged the\noffices around common spaces and introduced open stairwells between\nadjacent floors, all in an effort to support the type of serendipitous\nencounters that had defined its predecessor. But what struck me at the time\nwas a feature that hadn’t occurred to Gehry but had been recently added at\nthe faculty’s insistence: special gaskets installed into the office doorjambs\nto improve soundproofing. The professors at MIT—some of the most\ninnovative technologists in the world—wanted nothing to do with an open-\noffice-style workspace. They instead demanded the ability to close\nthemselves off.\nThis combination of soundproofed offices connected to large common\nareas yields a hub-and-spoke architecture of innovation in which both\nserendipitous encounter and isolated deep thinking are supported. It’s a\nsetup that straddles a spectrum where on one extreme we find the solo\nthinker, isolated from inspiration but free from distraction, and on the other\nextreme, we find the fully collaborative thinker in an open office, flush with\ninspiration but struggling to support the deep thinking needed to build on\nit.*\nIf we turn our attention back to Building 20 and Bell Labs, we see that\nthis is the architecture they deployed as well. Neither building offered\nanything resembling a modern open office plan. They were instead\nconstructed using the standard layout of private offices connected to shared\nhallways. Their creative mojo had more to do with the fact that these offices\nshared a small number of long connecting spaces—forcing researchers to\ninteract whenever they needed to travel from one location to another. These\nmega-hallways, in other words, provided highly effective hubs.\nWe can, therefore, still dismiss the depth-destroying open office concept\nwithout dismissing the innovation-producing theory of serendipitous\ncreativity. The key is to maintain both in a hub-and-spoke-style\narrangement: Expose yourself to ideas in hubs on a regular basis, but\nmaintain a spoke in which to work deeply on what you encounter.\nThis division of efforts, however, is not the full story, as even when one\nreturns to a spoke, solo work is still not necessarily the best strategy.\nConsider, for example, the previously mentioned invention of the (point-\ncontact) transistor at Bell Labs. This breakthrough was supported by a large\ngroup of researchers, all with separate specialties, who came together to\nform the solid-state physics research group—a team dedicated to inventing\na smaller and more reliable alternative to the vacuum tube. This group’s\ncollaborative conversations were necessary preconditions to the transistor: a\nclear example of the usefulness of hub behavior.\nOnce the research group laid the intellectual groundwork for the\ncomponent, the innovation process shifted to a spoke. What makes this\nparticular innovation process an interesting case, however, is that even\nwhen it shifted to a spoke it remained collaborative. It was two researchers\nin particular—the experimentalist Walter Brattain and the quantum theorist\nJohn Bardeen—who over a period of one month in 1947 made the series of\nbreakthroughs that led to the first working solid-state transistor.\nBrattain and Bardeen worked together during this period in a small lab,\noften side by side, pushing each other toward better and more effective\ndesigns. These efforts consisted primarily of deep work—but a type of deep\nwork we haven’t yet encountered. Brattain would concentrate intensely to\nengineer an experimental design that could exploit Bardeen’s latest\ntheoretical insight; then Bardeen would concentrate intensely to make sense\nof what Brattain’s latest experiments revealed, trying to expand his\ntheoretical framework to match the observations. This back-and-forth\nrepresents a collaborative form of deep work (common in academic circles)\nthat leverages what I call the whiteboard effect. For some types of\nproblems, working with someone else at the proverbial shared whiteboard\ncan push you deeper than if you were working alone. The presence of the\nother party waiting for your next insight—be it someone physically in the\nsame room or collaborating with you virtually—can short-circuit the natural\ninstinct to avoid depth.\nWe can now step back and draw some practical conclusions about the\nrole of collaboration in deep work. The success of Building 20 and Bell\nLabs indicates that isolation is not required for productive deep work.\nIndeed, their example indicates that for many types of work—especially\nwhen pursuing innovation—collaborative deep work can yield better\nresults. This strategy, therefore, asks that you consider this option in\ncontemplating how best to integrate depth into your professional life. In\ndoing so, however, keep the following two guidelines in mind.\nFirst, distraction remains a destroyer of depth. Therefore, the hub-and-\nspoke model provides a crucial template. Separate your pursuit of\nserendipitous encounters from your efforts to think deeply and build on\nthese inspirations. You should try to optimize each effort separately, as\nopposed to mixing them together into a sludge that impedes both goals.\nSecond, even when you retreat to a spoke to think deeply, when it’s\nreasonable to leverage the whiteboard effect, do so. By working side by side\nwith someone on a problem, you can push each other toward deeper levels\nof depth, and therefore toward the generation of more and more valuable\noutput as compared to working alone.\nWhen it comes to deep work, in other words, consider the use of\ncollaboration when appropriate, as it can push your results to a new level.\nAt the same time, don’t lionize this quest for interaction and positive\nrandomness to the point where it crowds out the unbroken concentration\nultimately required to wring something useful out of the swirl of ideas all\naround us.\nExecute Like a Business\nThe story has become lore in the world of business consulting. In the mid-\n1990s, Harvard Business School professor Clayton Christensen received a\ncall from Andy Grove, the CEO and chairman of Intel. Grove had\nencountered Christensen’s research on disruptive innovation and asked him\nto fly out to California to discuss the theory’s implications for Intel. On\narrival, Christensen walked through the basics of disruption: entrenched\ncompanies are often unexpectedly dethroned by start-ups that begin with\ncheap offerings at the low end of the market, but then, over time, improve\ntheir cheap products just enough to begin to steal high-end market share.\nGrove recognized that Intel faced this threat from low-end processors\nproduced by upstart companies like AMD and Cyrix. Fueled by his\nnewfound understanding of disruption, Grove devised the strategy that led\nto the Celeron family of processors—a lower-performance offering that\nhelped Intel successfully fight off the challenges from below.\nThere is, however, a lesser-known piece to this story. As Christensen\nrecalls, Grove asked him during a break in this meeting, “How do I do\nthis?” Christensen responded with a discussion of business strategy,\nexplaining how Grove could set up a new business unit and so on. Grove\ncut him off with a gruff reply: “You are such a naïve academic. I asked you\nhow to do it, and you told me what I should do. I know what I need to do. I\njust don’t know how to do it.”\nAs Christensen later explained, this division between what and how is\ncrucial but is overlooked in the professional world. It’s often\nstraightforward to identify a strategy needed to achieve a goal, but what\ntrips up companies is figuring out how to execute the strategy once\nidentified. I came across this story in a foreword Christensen wrote for a\nbook titled The 4 Disciplines of Execution, which built on extensive\nconsulting case studies to describe four “disciplines” (abbreviated, 4DX)\nfor helping companies successfully implement high-level strategies. What\nstruck me as I read was that this gap between what and how was relevant to\nmy personal quest to spend more time working deeply. Just as Andy Grove\nhad identified the importance of competing in the low-end processor\nmarket, I had identified the importance of prioritizing depth. What I needed\nwas help figuring out how to execute this strategy.\nIntrigued by these parallels, I set out to adapt the 4DX framework to my\npersonal work habits and ended up surprised by how helpful they proved in\ndriving me toward effective action on my goal of working deeply. These\nideas may have been forged for the world of big business, but the\nunderlying concepts seem to apply anywhere that something important\nneeds to get done against the backdrop of many competing obligations and\ndistractions. With this in mind, I’ve summarized in the following sections\nthe four disciplines of the 4DX framework, and for each I describe how I\nadapted it to the specific concerns of developing a deep work habit.\nDiscipline #1: Focus on the Wildly Important\nAs the authors of The 4 Disciplines of Execution explain, “The more you try\nto do, the less you actually accomplish.” They elaborate that execution\nshould be aimed at a small number of “wildly important goals.” This\nsimplicity will help focus an organization’s energy to a sufficient intensity\nto ignite real results.\nFor an individual focused on deep work, the implication is that you\nshould identify a small number of ambitious outcomes to pursue with your\ndeep work hours. The general exhortation to “spend more time working\ndeeply” doesn’t spark a lot of enthusiasm. To instead have a specific goal\nthat would return tangible and substantial professional benefits will\ngenerate a steadier stream of enthusiasm. In a 2014 column titled “The Art\nof Focus,” David Brooks endorsed this approach of letting ambitious goals\ndrive focused behavior, explaining: “If you want to win the war for\nattention, don’t try to say ‘no’ to the trivial distractions you find on the\ninformation smorgasbord; try to say ‘yes’ to the subject that arouses a\nterrifying longing, and let the terrifying longing crowd out everything else.”\nFor example, when I first began experimenting with 4DX, I set the\nspecific important goal of publishing five high-quality peer-reviewed papers\nin the upcoming academic year. This goal was ambitious, as it was more\npapers than I had been publishing, and there were tangible rewards attached\nto it (tenure review was looming). Combined, these two properties helped\nthe goal stoke my motivation.\nDiscipline #2: Act on the Lead Measures\nOnce you’ve identified a wildly important goal, you need to measure your\nsuccess. In 4DX, there are two types of metrics for this purpose: lag\nmeasures and lead measures. Lag measures describe the thing you’re\nultimately trying to improve. For example, if your goal is to increase\ncustomer satisfaction in your bakery, then the relevant lag measure is your\ncustomer satisfaction scores. As the 4DX authors explain, the problem with\nlag measures is that they come too late to change your behavior: “When you\nreceive them, the performance that drove them is already in the past.”\nLead measures, on the other hand, “measure the new behaviors that will\ndrive success on the lag measures.” In the bakery example, a good lead\nmeasure might be the number of customers who receive free samples. This\nis a number you can directly increase by giving out more samples. As you\nincrease this number, your lag measures will likely eventually improve as\nwell. In other words, lead measures turn your attention to improving the\nbehaviors you directly control in the near future that will then have a\npositive impact on your long-term goals.\nFor an individual focused on deep work, it’s easy to identify the relevant\nlead measure: time spent in a state of deep work dedicated toward your\nwildly important goal. Returning to my example, this insight had an\nimportant impact on how I directed my academic research. I used to focus\non lag measures, such as papers published per year. These measures,\nhowever, lacked influence on my day-to-day behavior because there was\nnothing I could do in the short term that could immediately generate a\nnoticeable change to this long-term metric. When I shifted to tracking deep\nwork hours, suddenly these measures became relevant to my day-to-day:\nEvery hour extra of deep work was immediately reflected in my tally.\nDiscipline #3: Keep a Compelling Scoreboard\n“People play differently when they’re keeping score,” the 4DX authors\nexplain. They then elaborate that when attempting to drive your team’s\nengagement toward your organization’s wildly important goal, it’s\nimportant that they have a public place to record and track their lead\nmeasures. This scoreboard creates a sense of competition that drives them\nto focus on these measures, even when other demands vie for their\nattention. It also provides a reinforcing source of motivation. Once the team\nnotices their success with a lead measure, they become invested in\nperpetuating this performance.\nIn the preceding discipline, I argued that for an individual focused on\ndeep work, hours spent working deeply should be the lead measure. It\nfollows, therefore, that the individual’s scoreboard should be a physical\nartifact in the workspace that displays the individual’s current deep work\nhour count.\nIn my early experiments with 4DX, I settled on a simple but effective\nsolution for implementing this scoreboard. I took a piece of card stock and\ndivided it into rows, one for each week of the current semester. I then\nlabeled each row with the dates of the week and taped it to the wall next to\nmy computer monitor (where it couldn’t be ignored). As each week\nprogressed, I kept track of the hours spent in deep work that week with a\nsimple tally of tick marks in that week’s row. To maximize the motivation\ngenerated by this scoreboard, whenever I reached an important milestone in\nan academic paper (e.g., solving a key proof), I would circle the tally mark\ncorresponding to the hour where I finished the result.* This served two\npurposes. First, it allowed me to connect, at a visceral level, accumulated\ndeep work hours and tangible results. Second, it helped calibrate my\nexpectations for how many hours of deep work were needed per result. This\nreality (which was larger than I first assumed) helped spur me to squeeze\nmore such hours into each week.\nDiscipline #4: Create a Cadence of Accountability\nThe 4DX authors elaborate that the final step to help maintain a focus on\nlead measures is to put in place “a rhythm of regular and frequent meetings\nof any team that owns a wildly important goal.” During these meetings, the\nteam members must confront their scoreboard, commit to specific actions to\nhelp improve the score before the next meeting, and describe what\nhappened with the commitments they made at the last meeting. They note\nthat this review can be condensed to only a few minutes, but it must be\nregular for its effect to be felt. The authors argue that it’s this discipline\nwhere “execution really happens.”\nFor an individual focused on his or her own deep work habit, there’s\nlikely no team to meet with, but this doesn’t exempt you from the need for\nregular accountability. In multiple places throughout this book I discuss and\nrecommend the habit of a weekly review in which you make a plan for the\nworkweek ahead (see Rule #4). During my experiments with 4DX, I used a\nweekly review to look over my scoreboard to celebrate good weeks, help\nunderstand what led to bad weeks, and most important, figure out how to\nensure a good score for the days ahead. This led me to adjust my schedule\nto meet the needs of my lead measure—enabling significantly more deep\nwork than if I had avoided such reviews altogether.\nThe 4DX framework is based on the fundamental premise that execution is\nmore difficult than strategizing. After hundreds and hundreds of case\nstudies, its inventors managed to isolate a few basic disciplines that seem to\nwork particularly well in conquering this difficulty. It’s no surprise,\ntherefore, that these same disciplines can have a similar effect on your\npersonal goal of cultivating a deep work habit.\nTo conclude, let’s return one last time to my own example. As I noted\nearlier, when I first embraced 4DX I adopted the goal of publishing five\npeer-reviewed papers in the 2013–2014 academic year. This was an\nambitious goal given that I had published only four papers the previous year\n(a feat I was proud of). Throughout this 4DX experiment, the clarity of this\ngoal, coupled with the simple but unavoidable feedback of my lead measure\nscoreboard, pushed me to a level of depth I hadn’t before achieved. In\nretrospect, it was not so much the intensity of my deep work periods that\nincreased, but instead their regularity. Whereas I used to cluster my deep\nthinking near paper submission deadlines, the 4DX habit kept my mind\nconcentrated throughout the full year. It ended up, I must admit, an\nexhausting year (especially given that I was writing this book at the same\ntime). But it also turned out to produce a convincing endorsement for the\n4DX framework: By the summer of 2014, I had nine full papers accepted\nfor publication, more than doubling what I had managed to accomplish in\nany preceding year.\nBe Lazy\nIn a 2012 article written for a New York Times blog, the essayist and\ncartoonist Tim Kreider provided a memorable self-description: “I am not\nbusy. I am the laziest ambitious person I know.” Kreider’s distaste for\nfrenetic work, however, was put to the test in the months leading up to the\nwriting of his post. Here’s his description of the period: “I’ve insidiously\nstarted, because of professional obligations, to become busy… every\nmorning my in-box was full of e-mails asking me to do things I did not\nwant to do or presenting me with problems that I now had to solve.”\nHis solution? He fled to what he calls an “undisclosed location”: a place\nwith no TV and no Internet (going online requires a bike ride to the local\nlibrary), and where he could remain nonresponsive to the pinprick\nonslaught of small obligations that seem harmless in isolation but aggregate\nto serious injury to his deep work habit. “I’ve remembered about\nbuttercups, stink bugs and the stars,” Kreider says about his retreat from\nactivity. “I read. And I’m finally getting some real writing done for the first\ntime in months.”\nIt’s important for our purposes to recognize that Kreider is no Thoreau.\nHe didn’t retreat from the world of busyness to underscore a complicated\nsocial critique. His move to an undisclosed location was instead motivated\nby a surprising but practical insight: It made him better at his job. Here’s\nKreider’s explanation:\nIdleness is not just a vacation, an indulgence or a vice; it is as\nindispensable to the brain as vitamin D is to the body, and deprived\nof it we suffer a mental affliction as disfiguring as rickets… it is,\nparadoxically, necessary to getting any work done.\nWhen Kreider talks of getting work done, of course, he’s not referencing\nshallow tasks. For the most part, the more time you can spend immersed in\nshallow work the more of it that gets accomplished. As a writer and artist,\nhowever, Kreider is instead concerned with deep work—the serious efforts\nthat produce things the world values. These efforts, he’s convinced, need\nthe support of a mind regularly released to leisure.\nThis strategy argues that you should follow Kreider’s lead by injecting\nregular and substantial freedom from professional concerns into your day,\nproviding you with the idleness paradoxically required to get (deep) work\ndone. There are many ways to accomplish this goal. You could, for\nexample, use Kreider’s approach of retreating from the world of shallow\ntasks altogether by hiding out in an “undisclosed location,” but this isn’t\npractical for most people. Instead, I want to suggest a more applicable but\nstill quite powerful heuristic: At the end of the workday, shut down your\nconsideration of work issues until the next morning—no after-dinner e-mail\ncheck, no mental replays of conversations, and no scheming about how\nyou’ll handle an upcoming challenge; shut down work thinking completely.\nIf you need more time, then extend your workday, but once you shut down,\nyour mind must be left free to encounter Kreider’s buttercups, stink bugs,\nand stars.\nBefore describing some tactics that support this strategy, I want to first\nexplore why a shutdown will be profitable to your ability to produce\nvaluable output. We have, of course, Tim Kreider’s personal endorsement,\nbut it’s worth taking the time to also understand the science behind the\nvalue of downtime. A closer examination of this literature reveals the\nfollowing three possible explanations for this value.\nReason #1: Downtime Aids Insights\nConsider the following excerpt from a 2006 paper that appeared in the\njournal Science:\nThe scientific literature has emphasized the benefits of conscious\ndeliberation in decision making for hundreds of years… The question\naddressed here is whether this view is justified. We hypothesize that it\nis not.\nLurking in this bland statement is a bold claim. The authors of this\nstudy, led by the Dutch psychologist Ap Dijksterhuis, set out to prove that\nsome decisions are better left to your unconscious mind to untangle. In\nother words, to actively try to work through these decisions will lead to a\nworse outcome than loading up the relevant information and then moving\non to something else while letting the subconscious layers of your mind\nmull things over.\nDijksterhuis’s team isolated this effect by giving subjects the\ninformation needed for a complex decision regarding a car purchase. Half\nthe subjects were told to think through the information and then make the\nbest decision. The other half were distracted by easy puzzles after they read\nthe information, and were then put on the spot to make a decision without\nhaving had time to consciously deliberate. The distracted group ended up\nperforming better.\nObservations from experiments such as this one led Dijksterhuis and his\ncollaborators to introduce unconscious thought theory (UTT)—an attempt\nto understand the different roles conscious and unconscious deliberation\nplay in decision making. At a high level, this theory proposes that for\ndecisions that require the application of strict rules, the conscious mind\nmust be involved. For example, if you need to do a math calculation, only\nyour conscious mind is able to follow the precise arithmetic rules needed\nfor correctness. On the other hand, for decisions that involve large amounts\nof information and multiple vague, and perhaps even conflicting,\nconstraints, your unconscious mind is well suited to tackle the issue. UTT\nhypothesizes that this is due to the fact that these regions of your brain have\nmore neuronal bandwidth available, allowing them to move around more\ninformation and sift through more potential solutions than your conscious\ncenters of thinking. Your conscious mind, according to this theory, is like a\nhome computer on which you can run carefully written programs that return\ncorrect answers to limited problems, whereas your unconscious mind is like\nGoogle’s vast data centers, in which statistical algorithms sift through\nterabytes of unstructured information, teasing out surprising useful\nsolutions to difficult questions.\nThe implication of this line of research is that providing your conscious\nbrain time to rest enables your unconscious mind to take a shift sorting\nthrough your most complex professional challenges. A shutdown habit,\ntherefore, is not necessarily reducing the amount of time you’re engaged in\nproductive work, but is instead diversifying the type of work you deploy.\nReason #2: Downtime Helps Recharge the Energy Needed to Work\nDeeply\nA frequently cited 2008 paper appearing in the journal Psychological\nScience describes a simple experiment. Subjects were split into two groups.\nOne group was asked to take a walk on a wooded path in an arboretum near\nthe Ann Arbor, Michigan, campus where the study was conducted. The\nother group was sent on a walk through the bustling center of the city. Both\ngroups were then given a concentration-sapping task called backward digit-\nspan. The core finding of the study is that the nature group performed up to\n20 percent better on the task. The nature advantage still held the next week\nwhen the researchers brought back the same subjects and switched the\nlocations: It wasn’t the people who determined performance, but whether or\nnot they got a chance to prepare by walking through the woods.\nThis study, it turns out, is one of many that validate attention restoration\ntheory (ART), which claims that spending time in nature can improve your\nability to concentrate. This theory, which was first proposed in the 1980s by\nthe University of Michigan psychologists Rachel Kaplan and Stephen\nKaplan (the latter of which co-authored the 2008 study discussed here,\nalong with Marc Berman and John Jonides), is based on the concept of\nattention fatigue. To concentrate requires what ART calls directed attention.\nThis resource is finite: If you exhaust it, you’ll struggle to concentrate. (For\nour purposes, we can think of this resource as the same thing as\nBaumeister’s limited willpower reserves we discussed in the introduction to\nthis rule.*) The 2008 study argues that walking on busy city streets requires\nyou to use directed attention, as you must navigate complicated tasks like\nfiguring out when to cross a street to not get run over, or when to maneuver\naround the slow group of tourists blocking the sidewalk. After just fifty\nminutes of this focused navigation, the subject’s store of directed attention\nwas low.\nWalking through nature, by contrast, exposes you to what lead author\nMarc Berman calls “inherently fascinating stimuli,” using sunsets as an\nexample. These stimuli “invoke attention modestly, allowing focused-\nattention mechanisms a chance to replenish.” Put another way, when\nwalking through nature, you’re freed from having to direct your attention,\nas there are few challenges to navigate (like crowded street crossings), and\nexperience enough interesting stimuli to keep your mind sufficiently\noccupied to avoid the need to actively aim your attention. This state allows\nyour directed attention resources time to replenish. After fifty minutes of\nsuch replenishment, the subjects enjoyed a boost in their concentration.\n(You might, of course, argue that perhaps being outside watching a\nsunset puts people in a good mood, and being in a good mood is what really\nhelps performance on these tasks. But in a sadistic twist, the researchers\ndebunked that hypothesis by repeating the experiment in the harsh Ann\nArbor winter. Walking outside in brutal cold conditions didn’t put the\nsubjects in a good mood, but they still ended up doing better on\nconcentration tasks.)\nWhat’s important to our purpose is observing that the implications of\nART expand beyond the benefits of nature. The core mechanism of this\ntheory is the idea that you can restore your ability to direct your attention if\nyou give this activity a rest. Walking in nature provides such a mental\nrespite, but so, too, can any number of relaxing activities so long as they\nprovide similar “inherently fascinating stimuli” and freedom from directed\nconcentration. Having a casual conversation with a friend, listening to\nmusic while making dinner, playing a game with your kids, going for a run\n—the types of activities that will fill your time in the evening if you enforce\na work shutdown—play the same attention-restoring role as walking in\nnature.\nOn the other hand, if you keep interrupting your evening to check and\nrespond to e-mail, or put aside a few hours after dinner to catch up on an\napproaching deadline, you’re robbing your directed attention centers of the\nuninterrupted rest they need for restoration. Even if these work dashes\nconsume only a small amount of time, they prevent you from reaching the\nlevels of deeper relaxation in which attention restoration can occur. Only\nthe confidence that you’re done with work until the next day can convince\nyour brain to downshift to the level where it can begin to recharge for the\nnext day to follow. Put another way, trying to squeeze a little more work out\nof your evenings might reduce your effectiveness the next day enough that\nyou end up getting less done than if you had instead respected a shutdown.\nReason #3: The Work That Evening Downtime Replaces Is Usually\nNot That Important\nThe final argument for maintaining a clear endpoint to your workday\nrequires us to return briefly to Anders Ericsson, the inventor of deliberate\npractice theory. As you might recall from Part 1, deliberate practice is the\nsystematic stretching of your ability for a given skill. It is the activity\nrequired to get better at something. Deep work and deliberate practice, as\nI’ve argued, overlap substantially. For our purposes here we can use\ndeliberate practice as a general-purpose stand-in for cognitively demanding\nefforts.\nIn Ericsson’s seminal 1993 paper on the topic, titled “The Role of\nDeliberate Practice in the Acquisition of Expert Performance,” he dedicates\na section to reviewing what the research literature reveals about an\nindividual’s capacity for cognitively demanding work. Ericsson notes that\nfor a novice, somewhere around an hour a day of intense concentration\nseems to be a limit, while for experts this number can expand to as many as\nfour hours—but rarely more.\nOne of the studies cited, for example, catalogs the practice habits of a\ngroup of elite violin players training at Berlin’s Universität der Künste. This\nstudy found the elite players average around three and a half hours per day\nin a state of deliberate practice, usually separated into two distinct periods.\nThe less accomplished players spent less time in a state of depth.\nThe implication of these results is that your capacity for deep work in a\ngiven day is limited. If you’re careful about your schedule (using, for\nexample, the type of productivity strategies described in Rule #4), you\nshould hit your daily deep work capacity during your workday. It follows,\ntherefore, that by evening, you’re beyond the point where you can continue\nto effectively work deeply. Any work you do fit into the night, therefore,\nwon’t be the type of high-value activities that really advance your career;\nyour efforts will instead likely be confined to low-value shallow tasks\n(executed at a slow, low-energy pace). By deferring evening work, in other\nwords, you’re not missing out on much of importance.\nThe three reasons just described support the general strategy of maintaining\na strict endpoint to your workday. Let’s conclude by filling in some details\nconcerning implementation.\nTo succeed with this strategy, you must first accept the commitment that\nonce your workday shuts down, you cannot allow even the smallest\nincursion of professional concerns into your field of attention. This\nincludes, crucially, checking e-mail, as well as browsing work-related\nwebsites. In both cases, even a brief intrusion of work can generate a self-\nreinforcing stream of distraction that impedes the shutdown advantages\ndescribed earlier for a long time to follow (most people are familiar, for\nexample, with the experience of glancing at an alarming e-mail on a\nSaturday morning and then having its implications haunt your thoughts for\nthe rest of the weekend).\nAnother key commitment for succeeding with this strategy is to support\nyour commitment to shutting down with a strict shutdown ritual that you\nuse at the end of the workday to maximize the probability that you succeed.\nIn more detail, this ritual should ensure that every incomplete task, goal, or\nproject has been reviewed and that for each you have confirmed that either\n(1) you have a plan you trust for its completion, or (2) it’s captured in a\nplace where it will be revisited when the time is right. The process should\nbe an algorithm: a series of steps you always conduct, one after another.\nWhen you’re done, have a set phrase you say that indicates completion (to\nend my own ritual, I say, “Shutdown complete”). This final step sounds\ncheesy, but it provides a simple cue to your mind that it’s safe to release\nwork-related thoughts for the rest of the day.\nTo make this suggestion more concrete, let me walk through the steps of\nmy own shutdown ritual (which I first developed around the time I was\nwriting my doctoral dissertation, and have deployed, in one form or another,\never since). The first thing I do is take a final look at my e-mail inbox to\nensure that there’s nothing requiring an urgent response before the day ends.\nThe next thing I do is transfer any new tasks that are on my mind or were\nscribbled down earlier in the day into my official task lists. (I use Google\nDocs for storing my task lists, as I like the ability to access them from any\ncomputer—but the technology here isn’t really relevant.) Once I have these\ntask lists open, I quickly skim every task in every list, and then look at the\nnext few days on my calendar. These two actions ensure that there’s nothing\nurgent I’m forgetting or any important deadlines or appointments sneaking\nup on me. I have, at this point, reviewed everything that’s on my\nprofessional plate. To end the ritual, I use this information to make a rough\nplan for the next day. Once the plan is created, I say, “Shutdown complete,”\nand my work thoughts are done for the day.\nThe concept of a shutdown ritual might at first seem extreme, but there’s\na good reason for it: the Zeigarnik effect. This effect, which is named for\nthe experimental work of the early-twentieth-century psychologist Bluma\nZeigarnik, describes the ability of incomplete tasks to dominate our\nattention. It tells us that if you simply stop whatever you are doing at five\np.m. and declare, “I’m done with work until tomorrow,” you’ll likely\nstruggle to keep your mind clear of professional issues, as the many\nobligations left unresolved in your mind will, as in Bluma Zeigarnik’s\nexperiments, keep battling for your attention throughout the evening (a\nbattle that they’ll often win).\nAt first, this challenge might seem unresolvable. As any busy\nknowledge worker can attest, there are always tasks left incomplete. The\nidea that you can ever reach a point where all your obligations are handled\nis a fantasy. Fortunately, we don’t need to complete a task to get it off our\nminds. Riding to our rescue in this matter is our friend from earlier in the\nrule, the psychologist Roy Baumeister, who wrote a paper with E.J.\nMasicampo playfully titled “Consider It Done!” In this study, the two\nresearchers began by replicating the Zeigarnik effect in their subjects (in\nthis case, the researchers assigned a task and then cruelly engineered\ninterruptions), but then found that they could significantly reduce the\neffect’s impact by asking the subjects, soon after the interruption, to make a\nplan for how they would later complete the incomplete task. To quote the\npaper: “Committing to a specific plan for a goal may therefore not only\nfacilitate attainment of the goal but may also free cognitive resources for\nother pursuits.”\nThe shutdown ritual described earlier leverages this tactic to battle the\nZeigarnik effect. While it doesn’t force you to explicitly identify a plan for\nevery single task in your task list (a burdensome requirement), it does force\nyou to capture every task in a common list, and then review these tasks\nbefore making a plan for the next day. This ritual ensures that no task will\nbe forgotten: Each will be reviewed daily and tackled when the time is\nappropriate. Your mind, in other words, is released from its duty to keep\ntrack of these obligations at every moment—your shutdown ritual has taken\nover that responsibility.\nShutdown rituals can become annoying, as they add an extra ten to\nfifteen minutes to the end of your workday (and sometimes even more), but\nthey’re necessary for reaping the rewards of systematic idleness\nsummarized previously. From my experience, it should take a week or two\nbefore the shutdown habit sticks—that is, until your mind trusts your ritual\nenough to actually begin to release work-related thoughts in the evening.\nBut once it does stick, the ritual will become a permanent fixture in your\nlife—to the point that skipping the routine will fill you with a sense of\nunease.\nDecades of work from multiple different subfields within psychology all\npoint toward the conclusion that regularly resting your brain improves the\nquality of your deep work. When you work, work hard. When you’re done,\nbe done. Your average e-mail response time might suffer some, but you’ll\nmore than make up for this with the sheer volume of truly important work\nproduced during the day by your refreshed ability to dive deeper than your\nexhausted peers.\nRule #2\nEmbrace Boredom\nTo better understand how one masters the art of deep work, I suggest\nvisiting the Knesses Yisroel Synagogue in Spring Valley, New York, at six\na.m. on a weekday morning. If you do, you’ll likely find at least twenty cars\nin the parking lot. Inside, you’ll encounter a couple dozen members of the\ncongregation working over texts—some might be reading silently,\nmouthing the words of an ancient language, while others are paired together\ndebating. At one end of the room a rabbi will be leading a larger group in a\ndiscussion. This early morning gathering in Spring Valley represents just a\nsmall fraction of the hundreds of thousands of orthodox Jews who will\nwake up early that morning, as they do every weekday morning, to practice\na central tenet of their faith: to spend time every day studying the complex\nwritten traditions of Rabbinic Judaism.\nI was introduced to this world by Adam Marlin, a member of the\nKnesses Yisroel congregation and one of the regulars at its morning study\ngroup. As Marlin explained to me, his goal with this practice is to decipher\none Talmud page each day (though he sometimes fails to make it even this\nfar), often working with a chevruta (study partner) to push his\nunderstanding closer to his cognitive limit.\nWhat interests me about Marlin is not his knowledge of ancient texts,\nbut instead the type of effort required to gain this knowledge. When I\ninterviewed him, he emphasized the mental intensity of his morning ritual.\n“It’s an extreme and serious discipline, consisting mostly of the ‘deep work’\nstuff [you write about],” he explained. “I run a growing business, but this is\noften the hardest brain strain I do.” This strain is not unique to Marlin but is\ninstead ingrained in the practice—as his rabbi once explained to him: “You\ncannot consider yourself as fulfilling this daily obligation unless you have\nstretched to the reaches of your mental capacity.”\nUnlike many orthodox Jews, Marlin came late to his faith, not starting\nhis rigorous Talmud training until his twenties. This bit of trivia proves\nuseful to our purposes because it allows Marlin a clear before-and-after\ncomparison concerning the impact of these mental calisthenics—and the\nresult surprised him. Though Marlin was exceptionally well educated when\nhe began the practice—he holds three different Ivy League degrees—he\nsoon met fellow adherents who had only ever attended small religious\nschools but could still “dance intellectual circles” around him. “A number\nof these people are highly successful [professionally],” he explained to me,\n“but it wasn’t some fancy school that pushed their intellect higher; it\nbecame clear it was instead their daily study that started as early as the fifth\ngrade.”\nAfter a while, Marlin began to notice positive changes in his own ability\nto think deeply. “I’ve recently been making more highly creative insights in\nmy business life,” he told me. “I’m convinced it’s related to this daily\nmental practice. This consistent strain has built my mental muscle over\nyears and years. This was not the goal when I started, but it is the effect.”\nAdam Marlin’s experience underscores an important reality about deep\nwork: The ability to concentrate intensely is a skill that must be trained.\nThis idea might sound obvious once it’s pointed out, but it represents a\ndeparture from how most people understand such matters. In my\nexperience, it’s common to treat undistracted concentration as a habit like\nflossing—something that you know how to do and know is good for you,\nbut that you’ve been neglecting due to a lack of motivation. This mind-set\nis appealing because it implies you can transform your working life from\ndistracted to focused overnight if you can simply muster enough\nmotivation. But this understanding ignores the difficulty of focus and the\nhours of practice necessary to strengthen your “mental muscle.” The\ncreative insights that Adam Marlin now experiences in his professional life,\nin other words, have little to do with a onetime decision to think deeper, and\nmuch to do with a commitment to training this ability early every morning.\nThere is, however, an important corollary to this idea: Efforts to deepen\nyour focus will struggle if you don’t simultaneously wean your mind from a\ndependence on distraction. Much in the same way that athletes must take\ncare of their bodies outside of their training sessions, you’ll struggle to\nachieve the deepest levels of concentration if you spend the rest of your\ntime fleeing the slightest hint of boredom.\nWe can find evidence for this claim in the research of Clifford Nass, the\nlate Stanford communications professor who was well known for his study\nof behavior in the digital age. Among other insights, Nass’s research\nrevealed that constant attention switching online has a lasting negative\neffect on your brain. Here’s Nass summarizing these findings in a 2010\ninterview with NPR’s Ira Flatow:\nSo we have scales that allow us to divide up people into people who\nmultitask all the time and people who rarely do, and the differences\nare remarkable. People who multitask all the time can’t filter out\nirrelevancy. They can’t manage a working memory. They’re\nchronically distracted. They initiate much larger parts of their brain\nthat are irrelevant to the task at hand… they’re pretty much mental\nwrecks.\nAt this point Flatow asks Nass whether the chronically distracted\nrecognize this rewiring of their brain:\nThe people we talk with continually said, “look, when I really have to\nconcentrate, I turn off everything and I am laser-focused.” And\nunfortunately, they’ve developed habits of mind that make it\nimpossible for them to be laser-focused. They’re suckers for\nirrelevancy. They just can’t keep on task. [emphasis mine]\nOnce your brain has become accustomed to on-demand distraction, Nass\ndiscovered, it’s hard to shake the addiction even when you want to\nconcentrate. To put this more concretely: If every moment of potential\nboredom in your life—say, having to wait five minutes in line or sit alone in\na restaurant until a friend arrives—is relieved with a quick glance at your\nsmartphone, then your brain has likely been rewired to a point where, like\nthe “mental wrecks” in Nass’s research, it’s not ready for deep work—even\nif you regularly schedule time to practice this concentration.\nRule #1 taught you how to integrate deep work into your schedule and\nsupport it with routines and rituals designed to help you consistently reach\nthe current limit of your concentration ability. Rule #2 will help you\nsignificantly improve this limit. The strategies that follow are motivated by\nthe key idea that getting the most out of your deep work habit requires\ntraining, and as clarified previously, this training must address two goals:\nimproving your ability to concentrate intensely and overcoming your desire\nfor distraction. These strategies cover a variety of approaches, from\nquarantining distraction to mastering a special form of meditation, that\ncombine to provide a practical road map for your journey from a mind\nwrecked by constant distraction and unfamiliar with concentration, to an\ninstrument that truly does deliver laser-like focus.\nDon’t Take Breaks from Distraction. Instead Take Breaks from\nFocus.\nMany assume that they can switch between a state of distraction and one of\nconcentration as needed, but as I just argued, this assumption is optimistic:\nOnce you’re wired for distraction, you crave it. Motivated by this reality,\nthis strategy is designed to help you rewire your brain to a configuration\nbetter suited to staying on task.\nBefore diving into the details, let’s start by considering a popular\nsuggestion for distraction addiction that doesn’t quite solve our problem:\nthe Internet Sabbath (sometimes called a digital detox). In its basic form,\nthis ritual asks you to put aside regular time—typically, one day a week—\nwhere you refrain from network technology. In the same way that the\nSabbath in the Hebrew Bible induces a period of quiet and reflection well\nsuited to appreciate God and his works, the Internet Sabbath is meant to\nremind you of what you miss when you are glued to a screen.\nIt’s unclear who first introduced the Internet Sabbath concept, but credit\nfor popularizing the idea often goes to the journalist William Powers, who\npromoted the practice in his 2010 reflection on technology and human\nhappiness, Hamlet’s BlackBerry. As Powers later summarizes in an\ninterview: “Do what Thoreau did, which is learn to have a little\ndisconnectedness within the connected world—don’t run away.”\nA lot of advice for the problem of distraction follows this general\ntemplate of finding occasional time to get away from the clatter. Some put\naside one or two months a year to escape these tethers, others follow\nPowers’s one-day-a-week advice, while others put aside an hour or two\nevery day for the same purpose. All forms of this advice provide some\nbenefit, but once we see the distraction problem in terms of brain wiring, it\nbecomes clear that an Internet Sabbath cannot by itself cure a distracted\nbrain. If you eat healthy just one day a week, you’re unlikely to lose weight,\nas the majority of your time is still spent gorging. Similarly, if you spend\njust one day a week resisting distraction, you’re unlikely to diminish your\nbrain’s craving for these stimuli, as most of your time is still spent giving in\nto it.\nI propose an alternative to the Internet Sabbath. Instead of scheduling\nthe occasional break from distraction so you can focus, you should instead\nschedule the occasional break from focus to give in to distraction. To make\nthis suggestion more concrete, let’s make the simplifying assumption that\nInternet use is synonymous with seeking distracting stimuli. (You can, of\ncourse, use the Internet in a way that’s focused and deep, but for a\ndistraction addict, this is a difficult task.) Similarly, let’s consider working\nin the absence of the Internet to be synonymous with more focused work.\n(You can, of course, find ways to be distracted without a network\nconnection, but these tend to be easier to resist.)\nWith these rough categorizations established, the strategy works as\nfollows: Schedule in advance when you’ll use the Internet, and then avoid it\naltogether outside these times. I suggest that you keep a notepad near your\ncomputer at work. On this pad, record the next time you’re allowed to use\nthe Internet. Until you arrive at that time, absolutely no network\nconnectivity is allowed—no matter how tempting.\nThe idea motivating this strategy is that the use of a distracting service\ndoes not, by itself, reduce your brain’s ability to focus. It’s instead the\nconstant switching from low-stimuli/high-value activities to high-\nstimuli/low-value activities, at the slightest hint of boredom or cognitive\nchallenge, that teaches your mind to never tolerate an absence of novelty.\nThis constant switching can be understood analogously as weakening the\nmental muscles responsible for organizing the many sources vying for your\nattention. By segregating Internet use (and therefore segregating\ndistractions) you’re minimizing the number of times you give in to\ndistraction, and by doing so you let these attention-selecting muscles\nstrengthen.\nFor example, if you’ve scheduled your next Internet block thirty minutes\nfrom the current moment, and you’re beginning to feel bored and crave\ndistraction, the next thirty minutes of resistance become a session of\nconcentration calisthenics. A full day of scheduled distraction therefore\nbecomes a full day of similar mental training.\nWhile the basic idea behind this strategy is straightforward, putting it\ninto practice can be tricky. To help you succeed, here are three important\npoints to consider.\nPoint #1: This strategy works even if your job requires lots of\nInternet use and/or prompt e-mail replies.\nIf you’re required to spend hours every day online or answer e-mails\nquickly, that’s fine: This simply means that your Internet blocks will be\nmore numerous than those of someone whose job requires less connectivity.\nThe total number or duration of your Internet blocks doesn’t matter nearly\nas much as making sure that the integrity of your offline blocks remains\nintact.\nImagine, for example, that over a two-hour period between meetings,\nyou must schedule an e-mail check every fifteen minutes. Further imagine\nthat these checks require, on average, five minutes. It’s sufficient, therefore,\nto schedule an Internet block every fifteen minutes through this two-hour\nstretch, with the rest of the time dedicated to offline blocks. In this example,\nyou’ll end up spending around ninety minutes out of this two-hour period in\na state where you’re offline and actively resisting distraction. This works\nout to be a large amount of concentration training that’s achieved without\nrequiring you to sacrifice too much connectivity.\nPoint #2: Regardless of how you schedule your Internet blocks, you\nmust keep the time outside these blocks absolutely free from\nInternet use.\nThis objective is easy to state in principle but quickly becomes tricky in the\nmessy reality of the standard workday. An inevitable issue you’ll face when\nexecuting this strategy is realizing early on in an offline block that there’s\nsome crucial piece of information online that you need to retrieve to\ncontinue making progress on your current task. If your next Internet block\ndoesn’t start for a while, you might end up stuck. The temptation in this\nsituation is to quickly give in, look up the information, then return to your\noffline block. You must resist this temptation! The Internet is seductive: You\nmay think you’re just retrieving a single key e-mail from your inbox, but\nyou’ll find it hard to not glance at the other “urgent” messages that have\nrecently arrived. It doesn’t take many of these exceptions before your mind\nbegins to treat the barrier between Internet and offline blocks as permeable\n—diminishing the benefits of this strategy.\nIt’s crucial in this situation, therefore, that you don’t immediately\nabandon an offline block, even when stuck. If it’s possible, switch to\nanother offline activity for the remainder of the current block (or perhaps\neven fill in this time relaxing). If this is infeasible—perhaps you need to get\nthe current offline activity done promptly—then the correct response is to\nchange your schedule so that your next Internet block begins sooner. The\nkey in making this change, however, is to not schedule the next Internet\nblock to occur immediately. Instead, enforce at least a five-minute gap\nbetween the current moment and the next time you can go online. This gap\nis minor, so it won’t excessively impede your progress, but from a\nbehavioralist perspective, it’s substantial because it separates the sensation\nof wanting to go online from the reward of actually doing so.\nPoint #3: Scheduling Internet use at home as well as at work can\nfurther improve your concentration training.\nIf you find yourself glued to a smartphone or laptop throughout your\nevenings and weekends, then it’s likely that your behavior outside of work\nis undoing many of your attempts during the workday to rewire your brain\n(which makes little distinction between the two settings). In this case, I\nwould suggest that you maintain the strategy of scheduling Internet use\neven after the workday is over.\nTo simplify matters, when scheduling Internet use after work, you can\nallow time-sensitive communication into your offline blocks (e.g., texting\nwith a friend to agree on where you’ll meet for dinner), as well as time-\nsensitive information retrieval (e.g., looking up the location of the\nrestaurant on your phone). Outside of these pragmatic exceptions, however,\nwhen in an offline block, put your phone away, ignore texts, and refrain\nfrom Internet usage. As in the workplace variation of this strategy, if the\nInternet plays a large and important role in your evening entertainment,\nthat’s fine: Schedule lots of long Internet blocks. The key here isn’t to avoid\nor even to reduce the total amount of time you spend engaging in distracting\nbehavior, but is instead to give yourself plenty of opportunities throughout\nyour evening to resist switching to these distractions at the slightest hint of\nboredom.\nOne place where this strategy becomes particularly difficult outside\nwork is when you’re forced to wait (for example, standing in line at a\nstore). It’s crucial in these situations that if you’re in an offline block, you\nsimply gird yourself for the temporary boredom, and fight through it with\nonly the company of your thoughts. To simply wait and be bored has\nbecome a novel experience in modern life, but from the perspective of\nconcentration training, it’s incredibly valuable.\nTo summarize, to succeed with deep work you must rewire your brain to be\ncomfortable resisting distracting stimuli. This doesn’t mean that you have to\neliminate distracting behaviors; it’s sufficient that you instead eliminate the\nability of such behaviors to hijack your attention. The simple strategy\nproposed here of scheduling Internet blocks goes a long way toward helping\nyou regain this attention autonomy.\nWork Like Teddy Roosevelt\nIf you attended Harvard College during the 1876–1877 school year, you\nwould’ve likely noticed a wiry, mutton-chopped, brash, and impossibly\nenergetic freshman named Theodore Roosevelt. If you then proceeded to\nbefriend this young man, you would’ve soon noticed a paradox.\nOn the one hand, his attention might appear to be hopelessly scattered,\nspread over what one classmate called an “amazing array of interests”—a\nlist that biographer Edmund Morris catalogs to contain boxing, wrestling,\nbody building, dance lessons, poetry readings, and the continuation of a\nlifelong obsession with naturalism (Roosevelt’s landlord on Winthrop Street\nwas not pleased with her young tenant’s tendency to dissect and stuff\nspecimens in his rented room). This latter interest developed to the point\nthat Roosevelt published his first book, The Summer Birds of the\nAdirondacks, in the summer after his freshman year. It was well received in\nthe Bulletin of the Nuttall Ornithological Club—a publication, needless to\nsay, which takes bird books quite seriously—and was good enough to lead\nMorris to assess Roosevelt, at this young age, to be “one of the most\nknowledgeable young naturalists in the United States.”\nTo support this extracurricular exuberance Roosevelt had to severely\nrestrict the time left available for what should have been his primary focus:\nhis studies at Harvard. Morris used Roosevelt’s diary and letters from this\nperiod to estimate that the future president was spending no more than a\nquarter of the typical day studying. One might expect therefore that\nRoosevelt’s grades would crater. But they didn’t. He wasn’t the top student\nin his class, but he certainly didn’t struggle either: In his freshman year he\nearned honor grades in five out of his seven courses. The explanation for\nthis Roosevelt paradox turns out to be his unique approach to tackling this\nschoolwork. Roosevelt would begin his scheduling by considering the eight\nhours from eight thirty a.m. to four thirty p.m. He would then remove the\ntime spent in recitation and classes, his athletic training (which was once a\nday), and lunch. The fragments that remained were then considered time\ndedicated exclusively to studying. As noted, these fragments didn’t usually\nadd up to a large number of total hours, but he would get the most out of\nthem by working only on schoolwork during these periods, and doing so\nwith a blistering intensity. “The amount of time he spent at his desk was\ncomparatively small,” explained Morris, “but his concentration was so\nintense, and his reading so rapid, that he could afford more time off [from\nschoolwork] than most.”\nThis strategy asks you to inject the occasional dash of Rooseveltian\nintensity into your own workday. In particular, identify a deep task (that is,\nsomething that requires deep work to complete) that’s high on your priority\nlist. Estimate how long you’d normally put aside for an obligation of this\ntype, then give yourself a hard deadline that drastically reduces this time. If\npossible, commit publicly to the deadline—for example, by telling the\nperson expecting the finished project when they should expect it. If this\nisn’t possible (or if it puts your job in jeopardy), then motivate yourself by\nsetting a countdown timer on your phone and propping it up where you\ncan’t avoid seeing it as you work.\nAt this point, there should be only one possible way to get the deep task\ndone in time: working with great intensity—no e-mail breaks, no\ndaydreaming, no Facebook browsing, no repeated trips to the coffee\nmachine. Like Roosevelt at Harvard, attack the task with every free neuron\nuntil it gives way under your unwavering barrage of concentration.\nTry this experiment no more than once a week at first—giving your\nbrain practice with intensity, but also giving it (and your stress levels) time\nto rest in between. Once you feel confident in your ability to trade\nconcentration for completion time, increase the frequency of these\nRoosevelt dashes. Remember, however, to always keep your self-imposed\ndeadlines right at the edge of feasibility. You should be able to consistently\nbeat the buzzer (or at least be close), but to do so should require teeth-\ngritting concentration.\nThe main motivation for this strategy is straightforward. Deep work\nrequires levels of concentration well beyond where most knowledge\nworkers are comfortable. Roosevelt dashes leverage artificial deadlines to\nhelp you systematically increase the level you can regularly achieve—\nproviding, in some sense, interval training for the attention centers of your\nbrain. An additional benefit is that these dashes are incompatible with\ndistraction (there’s no way you can give in to distraction and still make your\ndeadlines). Therefore, every completed dash provides a session in which\nyou’re potentially bored, and really want to seek more novel stimuli—but\nyou resist. As argued in the previous strategy, the more you practice\nresisting such urges, the easier such resistance becomes.\nAfter a few months of deploying this strategy, your understanding of\nwhat it means to focus will likely be transformed as you reach levels of\nintensity stronger than anything you’ve experienced before. And if you’re\nanything like a young Roosevelt, you can then repurpose the extra free time\nit generates toward the finer pleasures in life, like trying to impress the\nalways-discerning members of the Nuttall Ornithological Club.\nMeditate Productively\nDuring the two years I spent as a postdoctoral associate at MIT, my wife\nand I lived in a small but charming apartment on Pinckney Street, in\nhistoric Beacon Hill. Though I lived in Boston and worked in Cambridge,\nthe two locations were close—only a mile apart, sitting on opposite banks\nof the Charles River. Intent on staying fit, even during the long and dark\nNew England winter, I decided to take advantage of this proximity by\ntraveling between home and work, to the greatest extent possible, on foot.\nMy routine had me walk to campus in the morning, crossing the\nLongfellow Bridge in all weather (the city, it turns out to my dismay, is\noften slow to shovel the pedestrian path after snowstorms). Around lunch, I\nwould change into running gear and run back home on a longer path that\nfollowed the banks of the Charles, crossing at the Massachusetts Avenue\nBridge. After a quick lunch and shower at home, I would typically take the\nsubway across the river on the way back to campus (saving, perhaps, a third\nof a mile on the trek), and then walk home when the workday was done. In\nother words, I spent a lot of time on my feet during this period. It was this\nreality that led me to develop the practice that I’ll now suggest you adopt in\nyour own deep work training: productive meditation.\nThe goal of productive meditation is to take a period in which you’re\noccupied physically but not mentally—walking, jogging, driving,\nshowering—and focus your attention on a single well-defined professional\nproblem. Depending on your profession, this problem might be outlining an\narticle, writing a talk, making progress on a proof, or attempting to sharpen\na business strategy. As in mindfulness meditation, you must continue to\nbring your attention back to the problem at hand when it wanders or stalls.\nI used to practice productive meditation in at least one of my daily cross-\nriver treks while living in Boston, and as I improved, so did my results. I\nended up, for example, working out the chapter outlines for a significant\nportion of my last book while on foot, and made progress on many knotty\ntechnical problems in my academic research.\nI suggest that you adopt a productive meditation practice in your own\nlife. You don’t necessarily need a serious session every day, but your goal\nshould be to participate in at least two or three such sessions in a typical\nweek. Fortunately, finding time for this strategy is easy, as it takes\nadvantage of periods that would otherwise be wasted (such as walking the\ndog or commuting to work), and if done right, can actually increase your\nprofessional productivity instead of taking time away from your work. In\nfact, you might even consider scheduling a walk during your workday\nspecifically for the purpose of applying productive meditation to your most\npressing problem at the moment.\nI’m not, however, suggesting this practice for its productivity benefits\n(though they’re nice). I’m instead interested in its ability to rapidly improve\nyour ability to think deeply. In my experience, productive meditation builds\non both of the key ideas introduced at the beginning of this rule. By forcing\nyou to resist distraction and return your attention repeatedly to a well-\ndefined problem, it helps strengthen your distraction-resisting muscles, and\nby forcing you to push your focus deeper and deeper on a single problem, it\nsharpens your concentration.\nTo succeed with productive meditation, it’s important to recognize that,\nlike any form of meditation, it requires practice to do well. When I first\nattempted this strategy, back in the early weeks of my postdoc, I found\nmyself hopelessly distracted—ending long stretches of “thinking” with little\nnew to show for my efforts. It took me a dozen or so sessions before I\nbegan to experience real results. You should expect something similar, so\npatience will be necessary. To help accelerate this ramp-up process,\nhowever, I have two specific suggestions to offer.\nSuggestion #1: Be Wary of Distractions and Looping\nAs a novice, when you begin a productive meditation session, your mind’s\nfirst act of rebellion will be to offer unrelated but seemingly more\ninteresting thoughts. My mind, for example, was often successful at\nderailing my attention by beginning to compose an e-mail that I knew I\nneeded to write. Objectively speaking, this train of thought sounds\nexceedingly dull, but in the moment it can become impossibly tantalizing.\nWhen you notice your attention slipping away from the problem at hand,\ngently remind yourself that you can return to that thought later, then redirect\nyour attention back.\nDistraction of this type, in many ways, is the obvious enemy to defeat in\ndeveloping a productive meditation habit. A subtler, but equally effective\nadversary, is looping. When faced with a hard problem, your mind, as it was\nevolved to do, will attempt to avoid excess expenditure of energy when\npossible. One way it might attempt to sidestep this expenditure is by\navoiding diving deeper into the problem by instead looping over and over\nagain on what you already know about it. For example, when working on a\nproof, my mind has a tendency to rehash simple preliminary results, again\nand again, to avoid the harder work of building on these results toward the\nneeded solution. You must be on your guard for looping, as it can quickly\nsubvert an entire productive meditation session. When you notice it, remark\nto yourself that you seem to be in a loop, then redirect your attention toward\nthe next step.\nSuggestion #2: Structure Your Deep Thinking\n“Thinking deeply” about a problem seems like a self-evident activity, but in\nreality it’s not. When faced with a distraction-free mental landscape, a hard\nproblem, and time to think, the next steps can become surprisingly non-\nobvious. In my experience, it helps to have some structure for this deep\nthinking process. I suggest starting with a careful review of the relevant\nvariables for solving the problem and then storing these values in your\nworking memory. For example, if you’re working on the outline for a book\nchapter, the relevant variables might be the main points you want to make\nin the chapter. If you’re instead trying to solve a mathematics proof, these\nvariables might be actual variables, or assumptions, or lemmas. Once the\nrelevant variables are identified, define the specific next-step question you\nneed to answer using these variables. In the book chapter example, this\nnext-step question might be, “How am I going to effectively open this\nchapter?,” and for a proof it might be, “What can go wrong if I don’t\nassume this property holds?” With the relevant variables stored and the\nnext-step question identified, you now have a specific target for your\nattention.\nAssuming you’re able to solve your next-step question, the final step of\nthis structured approach to deep thinking is to consolidate your gains by\nreviewing clearly the answer you identified. At this point, you can push\nyourself to the next level of depth by starting the process over. This cycle of\nreviewing and storing variables, identifying and tackling the next-step\nquestion, then consolidating your gains is like an intense workout routine\nfor your concentration ability. It will help you get more out of your\nproductive meditation sessions and accelerate the pace at which you\nimprove your ability to go deep.\nMemorize a Deck of Cards\nGiven just five minutes, Daniel Kilov can memorize any of the following: a\nshuffled deck of cards, a string of one hundred random digits, or 115\nabstract shapes (this last feat establishing an Australian national record). It\nshouldn’t be surprising, therefore, that Kilov recently won back-to-back\nsilver medals in the Australian memory championships. What is perhaps\nsurprising, given Kilov’s history, is that he ended up a mental athlete at all.\n“I wasn’t born with an exceptional memory,” Kilov told me. Indeed,\nduring high school he considered himself forgetful and disorganized. He\nalso struggled academically and was eventually diagnosed with attention\ndeficit disorder. It was after a chance encounter with Tansel Ali, one of the\ncountry’s most successful and visible memory champions, that Kilov began\nto seriously train his memory. By the time he earned his college degree he\nhad won his first national competition medal.\nThis transformation into a world-class mental athlete was rapid, but not\nunprecedented. In 2006, the American science writer Joshua Foer won the\nUSA Memory Championship after only a year of (intense) training—a\njourney he chronicled in his 2011 bestseller, Moonwalking with Einstein.\nBut what’s important to us about Kilov’s story is what happened to his\nacademic performance during this period of intensive memory\ndevelopment. While training his brain, he went from a struggling student\nwith attention deficit disorder to graduating from a demanding Australian\nuniversity with first-class honors. He was soon accepted into the PhD\nprogram at one of the country’s top universities, where he currently studies\nunder a renowned philosopher.\nOne explanation for this transformation comes from research led by\nHenry Roediger, who runs the Memory Lab at the University of\nWashington in Saint Louis. In 2014, Roediger and his collaborators sent a\nteam, equipped with a battery of cognitive tests, to the Extreme Memory\nTournament held in San Diego. They wanted to understand what\ndifferentiated these elite memorizers from the population at large. “We\nfound that one of the biggest differences between memory athletes and the\nrest of us is in a cognitive ability that’s not a direct measure of memory at\nall but of attention,” explained Roediger in a New York Times blog post\n(emphasis mine). The ability in question is called “attentional control,” and\nit measures the subjects’ ability to maintain their focus on essential\ninformation.\nA side effect of memory training, in other words, is an improvement in\nyour general ability to concentrate. This ability can then be fruitfully\napplied to any task demanding deep work. Daniel Kilov, we can therefore\nconjecture, didn’t become a star student because of his award-winning\nmemory; it was instead his quest to improve this memory that (incidentally)\ngave him the deep work edge needed to thrive academically.\nThe strategy described here asks you to replicate a key piece of Kilov’s\ntraining, and therefore gain some of the same improvements to your\nconcentration. In particular, it asks you to learn a standard but quite\nimpressive skill in the repertoire of most mental athletes: the ability to\nmemorize a shuffled deck of cards.\nThe technique for card memorization I’ll teach you comes from someone\nwho knows quite a bit about this particular challenge: Ron White, a former\nUSA Memory Champion and world record holder in card memorization.*\nThe first thing White emphasizes is that professional memory athletes never\nattempt rote memorization, that is, where you simply look at information\nagain and again, repeating it in your head. This approach to retention,\nthough popular among burned-out students, misunderstands how our brains\nwork. We’re not wired to quickly internalize abstract information. We are,\nhowever, really good at remembering scenes. Think back to a recent\nmemorable event in your life: perhaps attending the opening session of a\nconference or meeting a friend you haven’t seen in a while for a drink. Try\nto picture the scene as clearly as possible. Most people in this scenario can\nconjure a surprisingly vivid recollection of the event—even though you\nmade no special effort to remember it at the time. If you systematically\ncounted the unique details in this memory, the total number of items would\nlikely be surprisingly numerous. Your mind, in other words, can quickly\nretain lots of detailed information—if it’s stored in the right way. Ron\nWhite’s card memorization technique builds on this insight.\nTo prepare for this high-volume memorization task, White recommends\nthat you begin by cementing in your mind the mental image of walking\nthrough five rooms in your home. Perhaps you come in the door, walk\nthrough your front hallway, then turn into the downstairs bathroom, walk\nout the door and enter the guest bedroom, walk into the kitchen, and then\nhead down the stairs into your basement. In each room, conjure a clear\nimage of what you see.\nOnce you can easily recall this mental walkthrough of a well-known\nlocation, fix in your mind a collection of ten items in each of these rooms.\nWhite recommends that these items be large (and therefore more\nmemorable), like a desk, not a pencil. Next, establish an order in which you\nlook at each of these items in each room. For example, in the front hallway,\nyou might look at the entry mat, then shoes on the floor by the mat, then the\nbench above the shoes, and so on. Combined this is only fifty items, so add\ntwo more items, perhaps in your backyard, to get to the full fifty-two items\nyou’ll later need when connecting these images to all the cards in a standard\ndeck.\nPractice this mental exercise of walking through the rooms, and looking\nat items in each room, in a set order. You should find that this type of\nmemorization, because it’s based on visual images of familiar places and\nthings, will be much easier than the rote memorizing you might remember\nfrom your school days.\nThe second step in preparing to memorize a deck of cards is to associate\na memorable person or thing with each of the fifty-two possible cards. To\nmake this process easier, try to maintain some logical association between\nthe card and the corresponding image. White provides the example of\nassociating Donald Trump with the King of Diamonds, as diamonds signify\nwealth. Practice these associations until you can pull a card randomly from\nthe deck and immediately recall the associated image. As before, the use of\nmemorable visual images and associations will simplify the task of forming\nthese connections.\nThe two steps mentioned previously are advance steps—things you do\njust once and can then leverage again and again in memorizing specific\ndecks. Once these steps are done, you’re ready for the main event:\nmemorizing as quickly as possible the order of fifty-two cards in a freshly\nshuffled deck. The method here is straightforward. Begin your mental walk-\nthrough of your house. As you encounter each item, look at the next card\nfrom the shuffled deck, and imagine the corresponding memorable person\nor thing doing something memorable near that item. For example, if the\nfirst item and location is the mat in your front entry, and the first card is the\nKing of Diamonds, you might picture Donald Trump wiping mud off of his\nexpensive loafers on the entry mat in your front hallway.\nProceed carefully through the rooms, associating the proper mental\nimages with objects in the proper order. After you complete a room, you\nmight want to walk through it a few times in a row to lock in the imagery.\nOnce you’re done, you’re ready to hand the deck to a friend and amaze him\nby rattling off the cards in order without peeking. To do so, of course,\nsimply requires that you perform the mental walk-through one more time,\nconnecting each memorable person or thing to its corresponding card as you\nturn your attention to it.\nIf you practice this technique, you’ll discover, like many mental athletes\nwho came before you, that you can eventually internalize a whole deck in\njust minutes. More important than your ability to impress friends, of course,\nis the training such activities provide your mind. Proceeding through the\nsteps described earlier requires that you focus your attention, again and\nagain, on a clear target. Like a muscle responding to weights, this will\nstrengthen your general ability to concentrate—allowing you to go deeper\nwith more ease.\nIt’s worth emphasizing, however, the obvious point that there’s nothing\nspecial about card memorization. Any structured thought process that\nrequires unwavering attention can have a similar effect—be it studying the\nTalmud, like Adam Marlin from Rule #2’s introduction, or practicing\nproductive meditation, or trying to learn the guitar part of a song by ear (a\npast favorite of mine). If card memorization seems weird to you, in other\nwords, then choose a replacement that makes similar cognitive\nrequirements. The key to this strategy is not the specifics, but instead the\nmotivating idea that your ability to concentrate is only as strong as your\ncommitment to train it.\nRule #3\nQuit Social Media\nIn 2013, author and digital media consultant Baratunde Thurston launched\nan experiment. He decided to disconnect from his online life for twenty-five\ndays: no Facebook, no Twitter, no Foursquare (a service that awarded him\n“Mayor of the Year” in 2011), not even e-mail. He needed the break.\nThurston, who is described by friends as “the most connected man in the\nworld,” had by his own count participated in more than fifty-nine thousand\nGmail conversations and posted fifteen hundred times on his Facebook wall\nin the year leading up to his experiment. “I was burnt out. Fried. Done.\nToast,” he explained.\nWe know about Thurston’s experiment because he wrote about it in a\ncover article for Fast Company magazine, ironically titled “#UnPlug.” As\nThurston reveals in the article, it didn’t take long to adjust to a disconnected\nlife. “By the end of that first week, the quiet rhythm of my days seemed far\nless strange,” he said. “I was less stressed about not knowing new things; I\nfelt that I still existed despite not having shared documentary evidence of\nsaid existence on the Internet.” Thurston struck up conversations with\nstrangers. He enjoyed food without Instagramming the experience. He\nbought a bike (“turns out it’s easier to ride the thing when you’re not trying\nto simultaneously check your Twitter”). “The end came too soon,” Thurston\nlamented. But he had start-ups to run and books to market, so after the\ntwenty-five days passed, he reluctantly reactivated his online presence.\nBaratunde Thurston’s experiment neatly summarizes two important\npoints about our culture’s current relationship with social networks like\nFacebook, Twitter, and Instagram, and infotainment sites like Business\nInsider and BuzzFeed—two categories of online distraction that I will\ncollectively call “network tools” in the pages ahead. The first point is that\nwe increasingly recognize that these tools fragment our time and reduce our\nability to concentrate. This reality no longer generates much debate; we all\nfeel it. This is a real problem for many different people, but the problem is\nespecially dire if you’re attempting to improve your ability to work deeply.\nIn the preceding rule, for example, I described several strategies to help you\nsharpen your focus. These efforts will become significantly more difficult if\nyou simultaneously behave like a pre-experiment Baratunde Thurston,\nallowing your life outside such training to remain a distracted blur of apps\nand browser tabs. Willpower is limited, and therefore the more enticing\ntools you have pulling at your attention, the harder it’ll be to maintain focus\non something important. To master the art of deep work, therefore, you\nmust take back control of your time and attention from the many diversions\nthat attempt to steal them.\nBefore we begin fighting back against these distractions, however, we\nmust better understand the battlefield. This brings me to the second\nimportant point summarized by Baratunde Thurston’s story: the impotence\nwith which knowledge workers currently discuss this problem of network\ntools and attention. Overwhelmed by these tools’ demands on his time,\nThurston felt that his only option was to (temporarily) quit the Internet\naltogether. This idea that a drastic Internet sabbatical* is the only\nalternative to the distraction generated by social media and infotainment has\nincreasingly pervaded our cultural conversation.\nThe problem with this binary response to this issue is that these two\nchoices are much too crude to be useful. The notion that you would quit the\nInternet is, of course, an overstuffed straw man, infeasible for most (unless\nyou’re a journalist writing a piece about distraction). No one is meant to\nactually follow Baratunde Thurston’s lead—and this reality provides\njustification for remaining with the only offered alternative: accepting our\ncurrent distracted state as inevitable. For all the insight and clarity that\nThurston gained during his Internet sabbatical, for example, it didn’t take\nhim long once the experiment ended to slide back into the fragmented state\nwhere he began. On the day when I first starting writing this chapter, which\nfell only six months after Thurston’s article originally appeared in Fast\nCompany, the reformed connector had already sent a dozen Tweets in the\nfew hours since he woke up.\nThis rule attempts to break us out of this rut by proposing a third option:\naccepting that these tools are not inherently evil, and that some of them\nmight be quite vital to your success and happiness, but at the same time also\naccepting that the threshold for allowing a site regular access to your time\nand attention (not to mention personal data) should be much more stringent,\nand that most people should therefore be using many fewer such tools. I\nwon’t ask you, in other words, to quit the Internet altogether like Baratunde\nThurston did for twenty-five days back in 2013. But I will ask you to reject\nthe state of distracted hyperconnectedness that drove him to that drastic\nexperiment in the first place. There is a middle ground, and if you’re\ninterested in developing a deep work habit, you must fight to get there.\nOur first step toward finding this middle ground in network tool selection is\nto understand the current default decision process deployed by most\nInternet users. In the fall of 2013, I received insight into this process\nbecause of an article I wrote explaining why I never joined Facebook.\nThough the piece was meant to be explanatory and not accusatory, it\nnonetheless put many readers on the defensive, leading them to reply with\njustifications for their use of the service. Here are some examples of these\njustifications:\n• “Entertainment was my initial draw to Facebook. I can see what my\nfriends are up to and post funny photos, make quick comments.”\n• “[When] I first joined, [I didn’t know why]… By mere curiosity I\njoined a forum of short fiction stories. [Once] there I improved my\nwriting and made very good friends.”\n• “[I use] Facebook because a lot of people I knew in high school are on\nthere.”\nHere’s what strikes me about these responses (which are representative\nof the large amount of feedback I received on this topic): They’re\nsurprisingly minor. I don’t doubt, for example, that the first commenter\nfrom this list finds some entertainment in using Facebook, but I would also\nassume that this person wasn’t suffering some severe deficit of\nentertainment options before he or she signed up for the service. I would\nfurther wager that this user would succeed in staving off boredom even if\nthe service were suddenly shut down. Facebook, at best, added one more\n(arguably quite mediocre) entertainment option to many that already\nexisted.\nAnother commenter cited making friends in a writing forum. I don’t\ndoubt the existence of these friends, but we can assume that these\nfriendships are lightweight—given that they’re based on sending short\nmessages back and forth over a computer network. There’s nothing wrong\nwith such lightweight friendships, but they’re unlikely to be at the center of\nthis user’s social life. Something similar can be said about the commenter\nwho reconnected with high school friends: This is a nice diversion, but\nhardly something central to his or her sense of social connection or\nhappiness.\nTo be clear, I’m not trying to denigrate the benefits identified previously\n—there’s nothing illusory or misguided about them. What I’m emphasizing,\nhowever, is that these benefits are minor and somewhat random. (By\ncontrast, if you’d instead asked someone to justify the use of, say, the World\nWide Web more generally, or e-mail, the arguments would become much\nmore concrete and compelling.) To this observation, you might reply that\nvalue is value: If you can find some extra benefit in using a service like\nFacebook—even if it’s small—then why not use it? I call this way of\nthinking the any-benefit mind-set, as it identifies any possible benefit as\nsufficient justification for using a network tool. In more detail:\nThe Any-Benefit Approach to Network Tool Selection: You’re justified in using a network\ntool if you can identify any possible benefit to its use, or anything you might possibly miss\nout on if you don’t use it.\nThe problem with this approach, of course, is that it ignores all the\nnegatives that come along with the tools in question. These services are\nengineered to be addictive—robbing time and attention from activities that\nmore directly support your professional and personal goals (such as deep\nwork). Eventually, if you use these tools enough, you’ll arrive at the state of\nburned-out, hyperdistracted connectivity that plagued Baratunde Thurston\nand millions of others like him. It’s here that we encounter the true\ninsidious nature of an any-benefit mind-set. The use of network tools can be\nharmful. If you don’t attempt to weigh pros against cons, but instead use\nany glimpse of some potential benefit as justification for unrestrained use of\na tool, then you’re unwittingly crippling your ability to succeed in the world\nof knowledge work.\nThis conclusion, if considered objectively, shouldn’t be surprising. In the\ncontext of network tools, we’ve become comfortable with the any-benefit\nmind-set, but if we instead zoom out and consider this mind-set in the\nbroader context of skilled labor, it suddenly seems a bizarre and ahistorical\napproach to choosing tools. In other words, once you put aside the\nrevolutionary rhetoric surrounding all things Internet—the sense,\nsummarized in Part 1, that you’re either fully committed to “the revolution”\nor a Luddite curmudgeon—you’ll soon realize that network tools are not\nexceptional; they’re tools, no different from a blacksmith’s hammer or an\nartist’s brush, used by skilled laborers to do their jobs better (and\noccasionally to enhance their leisure). Throughout history, skilled laborers\nhave applied sophistication and skepticism to their encounters with new\ntools and their decisions about whether to adopt them. There’s no reason\nwhy knowledge workers cannot do the same when it comes to the Internet\n—the fact that the skilled labor here now involves digital bits doesn’t\nchange this reality.\nTo help understand what this more careful tool curation might look like,\nit makes sense to start by talking to someone who makes a living working\nwith (nondigital) tools and relies on a complex relationship with these tools\nto succeed. Fortunately for our purposes, I found just such an individual in a\nlanky English major turned successful sustainable farmer, named (almost\ntoo aptly), Forrest Pritchard.\nForrest Pritchard runs Smith Meadows, a family farm located an hour west\nof D.C.—one of many farms clustered in the valleys of the Blue Ridge\nMountains. Soon after taking control of the land from his parents, as I\nlearned, Pritchard moved the operation away from traditional monoculture\ncrops and toward the then novel concept of grass-finished meat. The farm\nbypasses wholesaling—you cannot find Smith Meadows steaks in Whole\nFoods—to sell direct to consumers at the bustling farmers’ markets in the\nWashington, D.C., metro area. By all accounts, the farm is thriving in an\nindustry that rarely rewards small operations.\nI first encountered Pritchard at our local farmers’ market in Takoma\nPark, Maryland, where the Smith Meadows stand does good business. To\nsee Pritchard, usually standing a foot taller than most of his suburbanite\ncustomers, wearing the obligatory faded flannel of the farmer, is to see a\ncraftsman confident in his trade. I introduced myself to him because\nfarming is a skill dependent on the careful management of tools, and I\nwanted to understand how a craftsman in a nondigital field approaches this\ncrucial task.\n“Haymaking is a good example,” he told me, not long into one of our\nconversations on the topic. “It’s a subject where I can give you the basic\nidea without having to gloss over the underlying economics.”\nWhen Pritchard took over Smith Meadows, he explained, the farm made\nits own hay to use as animal feed during the winter months when grazing is\nimpossible. Haymaking is done with a piece of equipment called a hay\nbaler: a device you pull behind a tractor that compresses and binds dried\ngrass into bales. If you raise animals on the East Coast there’s an obvious\nreason to own and operate a hay baler: Your animals need hay. Why spend\nmoney to “buy in” feed when you have perfectly good grass growing for\nfree right in your own soil? If a farmer subscribed to the any-benefit\napproach used by knowledge workers, therefore, he would definitely buy a\nhay baler. But as Pritchard explained to me (after preemptively apologizing\nfor a moment of snark), if a farmer actually adopted such a simplistic mind-\nset, “I’d be counting the days until the ‘For Sale’ sign goes up on the\nproperty.” Pritchard, like most practitioners of his trade, instead deploys a\nmore sophisticated thought process when assessing tools. And after\napplying this process to the hay baler, Pritchard was quick to sell it: Smith\nMeadows now purchases all the hay it uses.\nHere’s why…\n“Let’s start by exploring the costs of making hay,” Pritchard said. “First,\nthere’s the actual cost of fuel, and repairs, and the shed to keep the baler.\nYou also have to pay taxes on it.” These directly measurable costs,\nhowever, were the easy part of his decision. It was instead the “opportunity\ncosts” that required more attention. As he elaborated: “If I make hay all\nsummer, I can’t be doing something else. For example, I now use that time\ninstead to raise boilers [chickens meant for eating]. These generate positive\ncash flow, because I can sell them. But they also produce manure which I\ncan then use to enhance my soil.” Then there’s the equally subtle issue of\nassessing the secondary value of a purchased bale of hay. As Pritchard\nexplained: “When I’m buying in hay, I’m trading cash for animal protein, as\nwell as manure (once it passes through the animals’ system), which means I\nam also getting more nutrients for my land in exchange for my money. I’m\nalso avoiding compacting soils by driving heavy machinery over my ground\nall summer long.”\nWhen making his final decision on the baler, Pritchard moved past the\ndirect monetary costs, which were essentially a wash, and instead shifted\nhis attention to the more nuanced issue of the long-term health of his fields.\nFor the reasons described previously, Pritchard concluded that buying in\nhay results in healthier fields. And as he summarized: “Soil fertility is my\nbaseline.” By this calculation, the baler had to go.\nNotice the complexity of Pritchard’s tool decision. This complexity\nunderscores an important reality: The notion that identifying some benefit is\nsufficient to invest money, time, and attention in a tool is near laughable to\npeople in his trade. Of course a hay baler offers benefits—every tool at the\nfarm supply store has something useful to offer. At the same time, of course\nit offers negatives as well. Pritchard expected this decision to be nuanced.\nHe began with a clear baseline—in his case, that soil health is of\nfundamental importance to his professional success—and then built off this\nfoundation toward a final call on whether to use a particular tool.\nI propose that if you’re a knowledge worker—especially one interested\nin cultivating a deep work habit—you should treat your tool selection with\nthe same level of care as other skilled workers, such as farmers. Following\nis my attempt to generalize this assessment strategy. I call it the craftsman\napproach to tool selection, a name that emphasizes that tools are ultimately\naids to the larger goals of one’s craft.\nThe Craftsman Approach to Tool Selection: Identify the core factors that determine\nsuccess and happiness in your professional and personal life. Adopt a tool only if its positive\nimpacts on these factors substantially outweigh its negative impacts.\nNotice that this craftsman approach to tool selection stands in opposition\nto the any-benefit approach. Whereas the any-benefit mind-set identifies\nany potential positive impact as justification for using a tool, the craftsman\nvariant requires that these positive impacts affect factors at the core of\nwhat’s important to you and that they outweigh the negatives.\nEven though the craftsman approach rejects the simplicity of the any-\nbenefit approach, it doesn’t ignore the benefits that currently drive people to\nnetwork tools, or make any advance proclamations about what’s “good” or\n“bad” technology: It simply asks that you give any particular network tool\nthe same type of measured, nuanced accounting that tools in other trades\nhave been subjected to throughout the history of skilled labor.\nThe three strategies that follow in this rule are designed to grow your\ncomfort with abandoning the any-benefit mind-set and instead applying the\nmore thoughtful craftsman philosophy in curating the tools that lay claim to\nyour time and attention. This guidance is important because the craftsman\napproach is not cut-and-dry. Identifying what matters most in your life, and\nthen attempting to assess the impacts of various tools on these factors,\ndoesn’t reduce to a simple formula—this task requires practice and\nexperimentation. The strategies that follow provide some structure for this\npractice and experimentation by forcing you to reconsider your network\ntools from many different angles. Combined, they should help you cultivate\na more sophisticated relationship with your tools that will allow you to take\nback enough control over your time and attention to enable the rest of the\nideas in Part 2 to succeed.\nApply the Law of the Vital Few to Your Internet Habits\nMalcolm Gladwell doesn’t use Twitter. In a 2013 interview he explained\nwhy: “Who says my fans want to hear from me on Twitter?” He then joked:\n“I know a lot of people would like to see less of me.” Michael Lewis,\nanother mega-bestselling author, also doesn’t use the service, explaining in\nThe Wire: “I don’t tweet, I don’t Twitter, I couldn’t even tell you how to\nread or where to find a Twitter message.” And as mentioned in Part 1, the\naward-winning New Yorker scribe George Packer also avoids the service,\nand indeed only recently even succumbed to the necessity of owning a\nsmartphone.\nThese three writers don’t think Twitter is useless. They’re quick to\naccept that other writers find it useful. Packer’s admission of non-Twitter\nuse, in fact, was written as a response to an unabashedly pro-Twitter article\nby the late New York Times media critic David Carr, a piece in which Carr\neffused:\nAnd now, nearly a year later, has Twitter turned my brain to mush?\nNo, I’m in narrative on more things in a given moment than I ever\nthought possible, and instead of spending a half-hour surfing in\nsearch of illumination, I get a sense of the day’s news and how\npeople are reacting to it in the time that it takes to wait for coffee at\nStarbucks.\nAt the same time, however, Gladwell, Lewis, and Packer don’t feel like\nthe service offers them nearly enough advantages to offset its negatives in\ntheir particular circumstances. Lewis, for example, worries that adding\nmore accessibility will sap his energy and reduce his ability to research and\nwrite great stories, noting: “It’s amazing how overly accessible people are.\nThere’s a lot of communication in my life that’s not enriching, it’s\nimpoverishing.” While Packer, for his part, worries about distraction,\nsaying: “Twitter is crack for media addicts.” He goes so far as to describe\nCarr’s rave about the service as “the most frightening picture of the future\nthat I’ve read thus far in the new decade.”\nWe don’t have to argue about whether these authors are right in their\npersonal decisions to avoid Twitter (and similar tools), because their sales\nnumbers and awards speak for themselves. We can instead use these\ndecisions as a courageous illustration of the craftsman approach to tool\nselection in action. In a time when so many knowledge workers—and\nespecially those in creative fields—are still trapped in the any-benefit mind-\nset, it’s refreshing to see a more mature approach to sorting through such\nservices. But the very rareness of these examples reminds us that mature\nand confident assessments of this type aren’t easy to make. Recall the\ncomplexity of the thought process, highlighted earlier, that Forrest Pritchard\nhad to slog through to make a decision on his hay baler: For many\nknowledge workers, and many of the tools in their lives, these decisions\nwill be equally complex. The goal of this strategy, therefore, is to offer\nsome structure to this thought process—a way to reduce some of the\ncomplexity of deciding which tools really matter to you.\nThe first step of this strategy is to identify the main high-level goals in both\nyour professional and your personal life. If you have a family, for example,\nthen your personal goals might involve parenting well and running an\norganized household. In the professional sphere, the details of these goals\ndepend on what you do for a living. In my own work as a professor, for\nexample, I pursue two important goals, one centered on being an effective\nteacher in the classroom and effective mentor to my graduate students, and\nanother centered on being an effective researcher. While your goals will\nlikely differ, the key is to keep the list limited to what’s most important and\nto keep the descriptions suitably high-level. (If your goal includes a specific\ntarget—“to reach a million dollars in sales” or “to publish a half dozen\npapers in a single year”—then it’s too specific for our purposes here.) When\nyou’re done you should have a small number of goals for both the personal\nand professional areas of your life.\nOnce you’ve identified these goals, list for each the two or three most\nimportant activities that help you satisfy the goal. These activities should be\nspecific enough to allow you to clearly picture doing them. On the other\nhand, they should be general enough that they’re not tied to a onetime\noutcome. For example, “do better research” is too general (what does it\nlook like to be “doing better research”?), while “finish paper on broadcast\nlower bounds in time for upcoming conference submission” is too specific\n(it’s a onetime outcome). A good activity in this context would be\nsomething like: “regularly read and understand the cutting-edge results in\nmy field.”\nThe next step in this strategy is to consider the network tools you\ncurrently use. For each such tool, go through the key activities you\nidentified and ask whether the use of the tool has a substantially positive\nimpact, a substantially negative impact, or little impact on your regular and\nsuccessful participation in the activity. Now comes the important decision:\nKeep using this tool only if you concluded that it has substantial positive\nimpacts and that these outweigh the negative impacts.\nTo help illustrate this strategy in action, let’s consider a case study. For\nthe purposes of this example, assume that Michael Lewis, if asked, would\nhave produced the following goal and corresponding important activities for\nhis writing career.\nProfessional Goal: To craft well-written, narrative-driven stories that\nchange the way people understand the world.\n \nKey Activities Supporting This Goal:\n• Research patiently and deeply.\n• Write carefully and with purpose.\nNow imagine that Lewis was using this goal to determine whether or not\nto use Twitter. Our strategy requires him to investigate Twitter’s impact on\nthe key activities he listed that support his goal. There’s no convincing way\nto argue that Twitter would make Lewis substantially better at either of\nthese activities. Deep research for Lewis, I assume, requires him to spend\nweeks and months getting to know a small number of sources (he’s a master\nof the long-form journalism skill of drawing out a source’s story over many\nsessions), and careful writing, of course, requires freedom from distraction.\nIn both cases, Twitter at best has no real impact, and at worst could be\nsubstantially negative, depending on Lewis’s susceptibility to the service’s\naddictive attributes. The conclusion would therefore be that Lewis shouldn’t\nuse Twitter.\nYou might argue at this point that confining our example to this single\ngoal is artificial, as it ignores the areas where a service like Twitter has its\nbest chance of contributing. For writers, in particular, Twitter is often\npresented as a tool to establish connections with your audience that\nultimately lead to more sales. For a writer like Michael Lewis, however,\nmarketing doesn’t likely merit its own goal when he assesses what’s\nimportant in his professional life. This follows because his reputation\nguarantees that he will receive massive coverage in massively influential\nmedia channels, if the book is really good. His focus, therefore, is much\nmore productively applied to the goal of writing the best possible book than\ninstead trying to squeeze out a few extra sales through inefficient author-\ndriven means. In other words, the question is not whether Twitter has some\nconceivable benefit to Lewis; it’s instead whether Twitter use significantly\nand positively affects the most important activities in his professional life.\nWhat about a less famous writer? In this case, book marketing might\nplay a more primary role in his or her goals. But when forced to identify the\ntwo or three most important activities supporting this goal, it’s unlikely that\nthe type of lightweight one-on-one contact enabled by Twitter would make\nthe list. This is the result of simple math. Imagine that our hypothetical\nauthor diligently sends ten individualized tweets a day, five days a week—\neach of which connects one-on-one with a new potential reader. Now\nimagine that 50 percent of the people contacted in this manner become\nloyal fans who will definitely buy the author’s next book. Over the two-year\nperiod it might take to write this book, this yields two thousand sales—a\nmodest boost at best in a marketplace where bestseller status requires two\nor three times more sales per week. The question once again is not whether\nTwitter offers some benefits, but instead whether it offers enough benefits to\noffset its drag on your time and attention (two resources that are especially\nvaluable to a writer).\nHaving seen an example of this approach applied to a professional\ncontext, let’s next consider the potentially more disruptive setting of\npersonal goals. In particular, let’s apply this approach to one of our culture’s\nmost ubiquitous and fiercely defended tools: Facebook.\nWhen justifying the use of Facebook (or similar social networks), most\npeople cite its importance to their social lives. With this in mind, let’s apply\nour strategy to understand whether Facebook makes the cut due to its\npositive impact on this aspect of our personal goals. To do so, we’ll once\nagain work with a hypothetical goal and key supporting activities.\nPersonal Goal: To maintain close and rewarding friendships with a\ngroup of people who are important to me.\n \nKey Activities Supporting This Goal:\n1. Regularly take the time for meaningful connection with those who\nare most important to me (e.g., a long talk, a meal, joint activity).\n2. Give of myself to those who are most important to me (e.g., making\nnontrivial sacrifices that improve their lives).\nNot everyone will share this exact goal or supporting activities, but\nhopefully you’ll stipulate that they apply to many people. Let’s now step\nback and apply our strategy’s filtering logic to the example of Facebook in\nthe context of this personal goal. This service, of course, offers any number\nof benefits to your social life. To name a few that are often mentioned: It\nallows you to catch up with people you haven’t seen in a while, it allows\nyou to maintain lightweight contact with people you know but don’t run\ninto regularly, it allows you to more easily monitor important events in\npeople’s lives (such as whether or not they’re married or what their new\nbaby looks like), and it allows you to stumble onto online communities or\ngroups that match your interests.\nThese are real benefits that Facebook undeniably offers, but none of\nthese benefits provide a significant positive impact to the two key activities\nwe listed, both of which are offline and effort intensive. Our strategy,\ntherefore, would return a perhaps surprising but clear conclusion: Of course\nFacebook offers benefits to your social life, but none are important enough\nto what really matters to you in this area to justify giving it access to your\ntime and attention.*\nTo be clear, I’m not arguing that everyone should stop using Facebook.\nI’m instead showing that for this specific (representative) case study, the\nstrategy proposed here would suggest dropping this service. I can imagine,\nhowever, other plausible scenarios that would lead to the opposite\nconclusion. Consider, for example, a college freshman. For someone in this\nsituation, it might be more important to establish new friendships than to\nsupport existing relationships. The activities this student identifies for\nsupporting his goal of a thriving social life, therefore, might include\nsomething like, “attend lots of events and socialize with lots of different\npeople.” If this is a key activity, and you’re on a college campus, then a tool\nlike Facebook would have a substantially positive impact and should be\nused.\nTo give another example, consider someone in the military who’s\ndeployed overseas. For this hypothetical soldier, keeping in frequent\nlightweight touch with friends and family left back home is a plausible\npriority, and one that might once again be best supported through social\nnetworks.\nWhat should be clear from these examples is that this strategy, if applied\nas described, will lead many people who currently use tools like Facebook\nor Twitter to abandon them—but not everyone. You might, at this point,\ncomplain about the arbitrariness of allowing only a small number of\nactivities to dominate your decisions about such tools. As we established\npreviously, for example, Facebook has many benefits to your social life;\nwhy would one abandon it just because it doesn’t happen to help the small\nnumber of activities that we judged most important? What’s key to\nunderstand here, however, is that this radical reduction of priorities is not\narbitrary, but is instead motivated by an idea that has arisen repeatedly in\nany number of different fields, from client profitability to social equality to\nprevention of crashes in computer programs.\nThe Law of the Vital Few*: In many settings, 80 percent of a given effect is due to just 20\npercent of the possible causes.\nFor example, it might be the case that 80 percent of a business’s profits\ncome from just 20 percent of its clients, 80 percent of a nation’s wealth is\nheld by its richest 20 percent of citizens, or 80 percent of computer software\ncrashes come from just 20 percent of the identified bugs. There’s a formal\nmathematical underpinning to this phenomenon (an 80/20 split is roughly\nwhat you would expect when describing a power law distribution over\nimpact—a type of distribution that shows up often when measuring\nquantities in the real world), but it’s probably most useful when applied\nheuristically as a reminder that, in many cases, contributions to an outcome\nare not evenly distributed.\nMoving forward, let’s assume that this law holds for the important goals\nin your life. As we noted, many different activities can contribute to your\nachieving these goals. The law of the vital few, however, reminds us that\nthe most important 20 percent or so of these activities provide the bulk of\nthe benefit. Assuming that you could probably list somewhere between ten\nand fifteen distinct and potentially beneficial activities for each of your life\ngoals, this law says that it’s the top two or three such activities—the number\nthat this strategy asks you to focus on—that make most of the difference in\nwhether or not you succeed with the goal.\nEven if you accept this result, however, you still might argue that you\nshouldn’t ignore the other 80 percent of possible beneficial activities. It’s\ntrue that these less important activities don’t contribute nearly as much to\nyour goal as your top one or two, but they can provide some benefit, so why\nnot keep them in the mix? As long as you don’t ignore the more important\nactivities, it seems like it can’t hurt to also support some of the less\nimportant alternatives.\nThis argument, however, misses the key point that all activities,\nregardless of their importance, consume your same limited store of time and\nattention. If you service low-impact activities, therefore, you’re taking away\ntime you could be spending on higher-impact activities. It’s a zero-sum\ngame. And because your time returns substantially more rewards when\ninvested in high-impact activities than when invested in low-impact\nactivities, the more of it you shift to the latter, the lower your overall\nbenefit.\nThe business world understands this math. This is why it’s not\nuncommon to see a company fire unproductive clients. If 80 percent of their\nprofits come from 20 percent of their clients, then they make more money\nby redirecting the energy from low-revenue clients to better service the\nsmall number of lucrative contracts—each hour spent on the latter returns\nmore revenue than each hour spent on the former. The same holds true for\nyour professional and personal goals. By taking the time consumed by low-\nimpact activities—like finding old friends on Facebook—and reinvesting in\nhigh-impact activities—like taking a good friend out to lunch—you end up\nmore successful in your goal. To abandon a network tool using this logic,\ntherefore, is not to miss out on its potential small benefits, but is instead to\nget more out of the activities you already know to yield large benefits.\nTo return to where we started, for Malcolm Gladwell, Michael Lewis,\nand George Packer, Twitter doesn’t support the 20 percent of activities that\ngenerate the bulk of the success in their writing careers. Even though in\nisolation this service might return some minor benefits, when their careers\nare viewed as a whole, they’re likely more successful not using Twitter, and\nredirecting that time to more fruitful activities, than if they added it into\ntheir schedule as one more thing to manage. You should take this same care\nin deciding which tools you allow to claim your own limited time and\nattention.\nQuit Social Media\nWhen Ryan Nicodemus decided to simplify his life, one of his first targets\nwas his possessions. At the time, Ryan lived alone in a spacious three-\nbedroom condo. For years, driven by a consumerist impulse, he had been\ntrying his best to fill this ample space. Now it was time to reclaim his life\nfrom his stuff. The strategy he deployed was simple to describe but radical\nin concept. He spent an afternoon packing everything he owned into\ncardboard boxes as if he was about to move. In order to transform what he\ndescribed as a “difficult undertaking” into something less onerous, he called\nit a “packing party,” explaining: “Everything’s more exciting when it’s a\nparty, right?”\nOnce the packing was done, Nicodemus then spent the next week going\nthrough his normal routine. If he needed something that was packed, he\nwould unpack it and put it back where it used to go. At the end of the week,\nhe noticed that the vast majority of his stuff remained untouched in its\nboxes.\nSo he got rid of it.\nStuff accumulates in people’s lives, in part, because when faced with a\nspecific act of elimination it’s easy to worry, “What if I need this one day?,”\nand then use this worry as an excuse to keep the item in question sitting\naround. Nicodemus’s packing party provided him with definitive evidence\nthat most of his stuff was not something he needed, and it therefore\nsupported his quest to simplify.\nThe last strategy provided a systematic method to help you begin sorting\nthrough the network tools that currently lay claim to your time and\nattention. This strategy offers you a different but complementary approach\nto these same issues, and it’s inspired by Ryan Nicodemus’s approach to\ngetting rid of his useless stuff.\nIn more detail, this strategy asks that you perform the equivalent of a\npacking party on the social media services that you currently use. Instead of\n“packing,” however, you’ll instead ban yourself from using them for thirty\ndays. All of them: Facebook, Instagram, Google+, Twitter, Snapchat, Vine\n—or whatever other services have risen to popularity since I first wrote\nthese words. Don’t formally deactivate these services, and (this is\nimportant) don’t mention online that you’ll be signing off: Just stop using\nthem, cold turkey. If someone reaches out to you by other means and asks\nwhy your activity on a particular service has fallen off, you can explain, but\ndon’t go out of your way to tell people.\nAfter thirty days of this self-imposed network isolation, ask yourself the\nfollowing two questions about each of the services you temporarily quit:\n1. Would the last thirty days have been notably better if I had been able\nto use this service?\n2. Did people care that I wasn’t using this service?\nIf your answer is “no” to both questions, quit the service permanently. If\nyour answer was a clear “yes,” then return to using the service. If your\nanswers are qualified or ambiguous, it’s up to you whether you return to the\nservice, though I would encourage you to lean toward quitting. (You can\nalways rejoin later.)\nThis strategy picks specifically on social media because among the\ndifferent network tools that can claim your time and attention, these\nservices, if used without limit, can be particularly devastating to your quest\nto work deeper. They offer personalized information arriving on an\nunpredictable intermittent schedule—making them massively addictive and\ntherefore capable of severely damaging your attempts to schedule and\nsucceed with any act of concentration. Given these dangers, you might\nexpect that more knowledge workers would avoid these tools altogether—\nespecially those like computer programmers or writers whose livelihood\nexplicitly depends on the outcome of deep work. But part of what makes\nsocial media insidious is that the companies that profit from your attention\nhave succeeded with a masterful marketing coup: convincing our culture\nthat if you don’t use their products you might miss out.\nThis fear that you might miss out has obvious parallels to Nicodemus’s\nfear that the voluminous stuff in his closets might one day prove useful,\nwhich is why I’m suggesting a corrective strategy that parallels his packing\nparty. By spending a month without these services, you can replace your\nfear that you might miss out—on events, on conversations, on shared\ncultural experience—with a dose of reality. For most people this reality will\nconfirm something that seems obvious only once you’ve done the hard\nwork of freeing yourself from the marketing messages surrounding these\ntools: They’re not really all that important in your life.\nThe reason why I ask you to not announce your thirty-day experiment is\nbecause for some people another part of the delusion that binds them to\nsocial media is the idea that people want to hear what you have to say, and\nthat they might be disappointed if you suddenly leave them bereft of your\ncommentary. I’m being somewhat facetious here in my wording, but this\nunderlying sentiment is nonetheless common and important to tackle. As of\nthis writing, for example, the average number of followers for a Twitter user\nis 208. When you know that more than two hundred people volunteered to\nhear what you have to say, it’s easy to begin to believe that your activities\non these services are important. Speaking from experience as someone who\nmakes a living trying to sell my ideas to people: This is a powerfully\naddictive feeling!\nBut here’s the reality of audiences in a social media era. Before these\nservices existed, building an audience of any size beyond your immediate\nfriends and family required hard, competitive work. In the early 2000s, for\nexample, anyone could start a blog, but to gain even just a handful of\nunique visitors per month required that you actually put in the work to\ndeliver information that’s valuable enough to capture someone’s attention. I\nknow this difficulty well. My first blog was started in the fall of 2003. It\nwas called, cleverly enough, Inspiring Moniker. I used it to muse on my life\nas a twenty-one-year-old college student. There were, I’m embarrassed to\nadmit, long stretches where no one read it (a term I’m using literally). As I\nlearned in the decade that followed, a period in which I patiently and\npainstakingly built an audience for my current blog, Study Hacks, from a\nhandful of readers to hundreds of thousands per month, is that earning\npeople’s attention online is hard, hard work.\nExcept now it’s not.\nPart of what fueled social media’s rapid assent, I contend, is its ability to\nshort-circuit this connection between the hard work of producing real value\nand the positive reward of having people pay attention to you. It has instead\nreplaced this timeless capitalist exchange with a shallow collectivist\nalternative: I’ll pay attention to what you say if you pay attention to what I\nsay—regardless of its value. A blog or magazine or television program that\ncontained the content that typically populates a Facebook wall or Twitter\nfeed, for example, would attract, on average, no audience. But when\ncaptured within the social conventions of these services, that same content\nwill attract attention in the form of likes and comments. The implicit\nagreement motivating this behavior is that in return for receiving (for the\nmost part, undeserved) attention from your friends and followers, you’ll\nreturn the favor by lavishing (similarly undeserved) attention on them. You\n“like” my status update and I’ll “like” yours. This agreement gives\neveryone a simulacrum of importance without requiring much effort in\nreturn.\nBy dropping off these services without notice you can test the reality of\nyour status as a content producer. For most people and most services, the\nnews might be sobering—no one outside your closest friends and family\nwill likely even notice you’ve signed off. I recognize that I come across as\ncurmudgeonly when talking about this issue—is there any other way to\ntackle it?—but it’s important to discuss because this quest for self-\nimportance plays an important role in convincing people to continue to\nthoughtlessly fragment their time and attention.\nFor some people, of course, this thirty-day experiment will be difficult\nand generate lots of issues. If you’re a college student or online personality,\nfor example, the abstention will complicate your life and will be noted. But\nfor most, I suspect, the net result of this experiment, if not a massive\noverhaul in your Internet habits, will be a more grounded view of the role\nsocial media plays in your daily existence. These services aren’t necessarily,\nas advertised, the lifeblood of our modern connected world. They’re just\nproducts, developed by private companies, funded lavishly, marketed\ncarefully, and designed ultimately to capture then sell your personal\ninformation and attention to advertisers. They can be fun, but in the scheme\nof your life and what you want to accomplish, they’re a lightweight\nwhimsy, one unimportant distraction among many threatening to derail you\nfrom something deeper. Or maybe social media tools are at the core of your\nexistence. You won’t know either way until you sample life without them.\nDon’t Use the Internet to Entertain Yourself\nArnold Bennett was an English writer born near the turn of the twentieth\ncentury—a tumultuous time for his home country’s economy. The industrial\nrevolution, which had been roaring for decades by this point, had wrenched\nenough surplus capital from the empire’s resources to generate a new class:\nthe white-collar worker. It was now possible to have a job in which you\nspent a set number of hours a week in an office, and in exchange received a\nsteady salary sufficient to support a household. Such a lifestyle is blandly\nfamiliar in our current age, but to Bennett and his contemporaries it was\nnovel and in many ways distressing. Chief among Bennett’s concerns was\nthat members of this new class were missing out on the opportunities it\npresented to live a full life.\n“Take the case of a Londoner who works in an office, whose office\nhours are from ten to six, and who spends fifty minutes morning and night\nin travelling between his house door and his office door,” Bennett writes in\nhis 1910 self-help classic, How to Live on 24 Hours a Day. This\nhypothetical London salaryman, he notes, has a little more than sixteen\nhours left in the day beyond these work-related hours. To Bennett, this is a\nlot of time, but most people in this situation tragically don’t realize its\npotential. The “great and profound mistake which my typical man makes in\nregard to his day,” he elaborates, is that even though he doesn’t particularly\nenjoy his work (seeing it as something to “get through”), “he persists in\nlooking upon those hours from ten to six as ‘the day,’ to which the ten hours\npreceding them and the six hours following them are nothing but a prologue\nand epilogue.” This is an attitude that Bennett condemns as “utterly\nillogical and unhealthy.”\nWhat’s the alternative to this state of affairs? Bennett suggests that his\ntypical man see his sixteen free hours as a “day within a day,” explaining,\n“during those sixteen hours he is free; he is not a wage-earner; he is not\npreoccupied with monetary cares; he is just as good as a man with a private\nincome.” Accordingly, the typical man should instead use this time as an\naristocrat would: to perform rigorous self-improvement—a task that,\naccording to Bennett, involves, primarily, reading great literature and\npoetry.\nBennett wrote about these issues more than a century ago. You might\nexpect that in the intervening decades, a period in which this middle class\nexploded in size worldwide, our thinking about leisure time would have\nevolved. But it has not. If anything, with the rise of the Internet and the\nlow-brow attention economy it supports, the average forty-hour-a-week\nemployee—especially those in my tech-savvy Millennial generation—has\nseen the quality of his or her leisure time remain degraded, consisting\nprimarily of a blur of distracted clicks on least-common-denominator digital\nentertainment. If Bennett were brought back to life today, he’d likely fall\ninto despair at the lack of progress in this area of human development.\nTo be clear, I’m indifferent to the moral underpinnings behind Bennett’s\nsuggestions. His vision of elevating the souls and minds of the middle class\nby reading poetry and great books feels somewhat antiquated and classist.\nBut the logical foundation of his proposal, that you both should and can\nmake deliberate use of your time outside work, remains relevant today—\nespecially with respect to the goal of this rule, which is to reduce the impact\nof network tools on your ability to perform deep work.\nIn more detail, in the strategies discussed so far in this rule, we haven’t\nspent much time yet on a class of network tools that are particularly\nrelevant to the fight for depth: entertainment-focused websites designed to\ncapture and hold your attention for as long as possible. At the time of this\nwriting, the most popular examples of such sites include the Huffington\nPost, BuzzFeed, Business Insider, and Reddit. This list will undoubtedly\ncontinue to evolve, but what this general category of sites shares is the use\nof carefully crafted titles and easily digestible content, often honed by\nalgorithms to be maximally attention catching.\nOnce you’ve landed on one article in one of these sites, links on the side\nor bottom of the page beckon you to click on another, then another. Every\navailable trick of human psychology, from listing titles as “popular” or\n“trending,” to the use of arresting photos, is used to keep you engaged. At\nthis particular moment, for example, some of the most popular articles on\nBuzzFeed include, “17 Words That Mean Something Totally Different\nWhen Spelled Backward” and “33 Dogs Winning at Everything.”\nThese sites are especially harmful after the workday is over, where the\nfreedom in your schedule enables them to become central to your leisure\ntime. If you’re waiting in line, or waiting for the plot to pick up in a TV\nshow, or waiting to finish eating a meal, they provide a cognitive crutch to\nensure you eliminate any chance of boredom. As I argued in Rule #2,\nhowever, such behavior is dangerous, as it weakens your mind’s general\nability to resist distraction, making deep work difficult later when you really\nwant to concentrate. To make matters worse, these network tools are not\nsomething you join and therefore they’re not something you can remove\nfrom your life by quitting (rendering the previous two strategies irrelevant).\nThey’re always available, just a quick click away.\nFortunately, Arnold Bennett identified the solution to this problem a\nhundred years earlier: Put more thought into your leisure time. In other\nwords, this strategy suggests that when it comes to your relaxation, don’t\ndefault to whatever catches your attention at the moment, but instead\ndedicate some advance thinking to the question of how you want to spend\nyour “day within a day.” Addictive websites of the type mentioned\npreviously thrive in a vacuum: If you haven’t given yourself something to\ndo in a given moment, they’ll always beckon as an appealing option. If you\ninstead fill this free time with something of more quality, their grip on your\nattention will loosen.\nIt’s crucial, therefore, that you figure out in advance what you’re going\nto do with your evenings and weekends before they begin. Structured\nhobbies provide good fodder for these hours, as they generate specific\nactions with specific goals to fill your time. A set program of reading, à la\nBennett, where you spend regular time each night making progress on a\nseries of deliberately chosen books, is also a good option, as is, of course,\nexercise or the enjoyment of good (in-person) company.\nIn my own life, for example, I manage to read a surprising number of\nbooks in a typical year, given the demands on my time as a professor,\nwriter, and father (on average, I’m typically reading three to five books at a\ntime). This is possible because one of my favorite preplanned leisure\nactivities after my kids’ bedtime is to read an interesting book. As a result,\nmy smartphone and computer, and the distractions they can offer, typically\nremain neglected between the end of the workday and the next morning.\nAt this point you might worry that adding such structure to your\nrelaxation will defeat the purpose of relaxing, which many believe requires\ncomplete freedom from plans or obligations. Won’t a structured evening\nleave you exhausted—not refreshed—the next day at work? Bennett, to his\ncredit, anticipated this complaint. As he argues, such worries misunderstand\nwhat energizes the human spirit:\nWhat? You say that full energy given to those sixteen hours will\nlessen the value of the business eight? Not so. On the contrary, it will\nassuredly increase the value of the business eight. One of the chief\nthings which my typical man has to learn is that the mental faculties\nare capable of a continuous hard activity; they do not tire like an arm\nor a leg. All they want is change—not rest, except in sleep.\nIn my experience, this analysis is spot-on. If you give your mind\nsomething meaningful to do throughout all your waking hours, you’ll end\nthe day more fulfilled, and begin the next one more relaxed, than if you\ninstead allow your mind to bathe for hours in semiconscious and\nunstructured Web surfing.\nTo summarize, if you want to eliminate the addictive pull of\nentertainment sites on your time and attention, give your brain a quality\nalternative. Not only will this preserve your ability to resist distraction and\nconcentrate, but you might even fulfill Arnold Bennett’s ambitious goal of\nexperiencing, perhaps for the first time, what it means to live, and not just\nexist.\nRule #4\nDrain the Shallows\nIn the summer of 2007, the software company 37signals (now called\nBasecamp) launched an experiment: They shortened their workweek from\nfive days to four. Their employees seemed to accomplish the same amount\nof work with one less day, so they made this change permanent: Every year,\nfrom May through October, 37signals employees work only Monday to\nThursday (with the exception of customer support, which still operates the\nfull week). As company cofounder Jason Fried quipped in a blog post about\nthe decision: “People should enjoy the weather in the summer.”\nIt didn’t take long before the grumbles began in the business press. A\nfew months after Fried announced his company’s decision to make four-day\nweeks permanent, journalist Tara Weiss wrote a critical piece for Forbes\ntitled “Why a Four-Day Work Week Doesn’t Work.” She summarized her\nproblem with this strategy as follows:\nPacking 40 hours into four days isn’t necessarily an efficient way to\nwork. Many people find that eight hours are tough enough; requiring\nthem to stay for an extra two could cause morale and productivity to\ndecrease.\nFried was quick to respond. In a blog post titled “Forbes Misses the\nPoint of the 4-Day Work Week,” he begins by agreeing with Weiss’s\npremise that it would be stressful for employees to cram forty hours of\neffort into four days. But, as he clarifies, that’s not what he’s suggesting.\n“The point of the 4-day work week is about doing less work,” he writes.\n“It’s not about four 10-hour days… it’s about four normalish 8-hour days.”\nThis might seem confusing at first. Fried earlier claimed that his\nemployees get just as much done in four days as in five days. Now,\nhowever, he’s claiming that his employees are working fewer hours. How\ncan both be true? The difference, it turns out, concerns the role of shallow\nwork. As Fried expands:\nVery few people work even 8 hours a day. You’re lucky if you get a\nfew good hours in between all the meetings, interruptions, web\nsurfing, office politics, and personal business that permeate the\ntypical workday.\nFewer official working hours helps squeeze the fat out of the\ntypical workweek. Once everyone has less time to get their stuff done,\nthey respect that time even more. People become stingy with their\ntime and that’s a good thing. They don’t waste it on things that just\ndon’t matter. When you have fewer hours you usually spend them\nmore wisely.\nIn \nother \nwords, \nthe \nreduction \nin \nthe \n37signals \nworkweek\ndisproportionately eliminated shallow as compared to deep work, and\nbecause the latter was left largely untouched, the important stuff continued\nto get done. The shallow stuff that can seem so urgent in the moment turned\nout to be unexpectedly dispensable.\nA natural reaction to this experiment is to wonder what would happen if\n37signals had gone one step further. If eliminating hours of shallow work\nhad little impact on the results produced, what would happen if they not\nonly eliminated shallow work, but then replaced this newly recovered time\nwith more deep work? Fortunately for our curiosity, the company soon put\nthis bolder idea to the test as well.\nFried had always been interested in the policies of technology\ncompanies like Google that gave their employees 20 percent of their time to\nwork on self-directed projects. While he liked this idea, he felt that carving\none day out of an otherwise busy week was not enough to support the type\nof unbroken deep work that generates true breakthroughs. “I’d take 5 days\nin a row over 5 days spread out over 5 weeks,” he explained. “So our theory\nis that we’ll see better results when people have a long stretch of\nuninterrupted time.”\nTo test this theory, 37signals implemented something radical: The\ncompany gave its employees the entire month of June off to work deeply on\ntheir own projects. This month would be a period free of any shallow work\nobligations—no status meetings, no memos, and, blessedly, no PowerPoint.\nAt the end of the month, the company held a “pitch day” in which\nemployees pitched the ideas they’d been working on. Summarizing the\nexperiment in an Inc. magazine article, Fried dubbed it a success. The pitch\nday produced two projects that were soon put into production: a better suite\nof tools for handling customer support and a data visualization system that\nhelps the company understand how their customers use their products.\nThese projects are predicted to bring substantial value to the company, but\nthey almost certainly would not have been produced in the absence of the\nunobstructed deep work time provided to the employees. To tease out their\npotential required dozens of hours of unimpeded effort.\n“How can we afford to put our business on hold for a month to ‘mess\naround’ with new ideas?” Fried asked rhetorically. “How can we afford not\nto?”\n37signals’ experiments highlight an important reality: The shallow work\nthat increasingly dominates the time and attention of knowledge workers is\nless vital than it often seems in the moment. For most businesses, if you\neliminated significant amounts of this shallowness, their bottom line would\nlikely remain unaffected. And as Jason Fried discovered, if you not only\neliminate shallow work, but also replace this recovered time with more of\nthe deep alternative, not only will the business continue to function; it can\nbecome more successful.\nThis rule asks you to apply these insights to your personal work life. The\nstrategies that follow are designed to help you ruthlessly identify the\nshallowness in your current schedule, then cull it down to minimum levels\n—leaving more time for the deep efforts that ultimately matter most.\nBefore diving into the details of these strategies, however, we should\nfirst confront the reality that there’s a limit to this anti-shallow thinking.\nThe value of deep work vastly outweighs the value of shallow, but this\ndoesn’t mean that you must quixotically pursue a schedule in which all of\nyour time is invested in depth. For one thing, a nontrivial amount of shallow\nwork is needed to maintain most knowledge work jobs. You might be able\nto avoid checking your e-mail every ten minutes, but you won’t likely last\nlong if you never respond to important messages. In this sense, we should\nsee the goal of this rule as taming shallow work’s footprint in your\nschedule, not eliminating it.\nThen there’s the issue of cognitive capacity. Deep work is exhausting\nbecause it pushes you toward the limit of your abilities. Performance\npsychologists have extensively studied how much such efforts can be\nsustained by an individual in a given day.* In their seminal paper on\ndeliberate practice, Anders Ericsson and his collaborators survey these\nstudies. They note that for someone new to such practice (citing, in\nparticular, a child in the early stages of developing an expert-level skill), an\nhour a day is a reasonable limit. For those familiar with the rigors of such\nactivities, the limit expands to something like four hours, but rarely more.\nThe implication is that once you’ve hit your deep work limit in a given\nday, you’ll experience diminishing rewards if you try to cram in more.\nShallow work, therefore, doesn’t become dangerous until after you add\nenough to begin to crowd out your bounded deep efforts for the day. At\nfirst, this caveat might seem optimistic. The typical workday is eight hours.\nThe most adept deep thinker cannot spend more than four of these hours in\na state of true depth. It follows that you can safely spend half the day\nwallowing in the shallows without adverse effect. The danger missed by\nthis analysis is how easily this amount of time can be consumed, especially\nonce you consider the impact of meetings, appointments, calls, and other\nscheduled events. For many jobs, these time drains can leave you with\nsurprisingly little time left for solo work.\nMy job as a professor, for example, is traditionally less plagued by such\ncommitments, but even so, they often take large chunks out of my time,\nespecially during the academic year. Turning to a random day in my\ncalendar from the previous semester (I’m writing this during a quiet\nsummer month), for example, I see I had a meeting from eleven to twelve,\nanother from one to two thirty, and a class to teach from three to five. My\neight-hour workday in this example is already reduced by four hours. Even\nif I squeezed all remaining shallow work (e-mails, tasks) into a single half\nhour, I’d still fall short of the goal of four hours of daily deep work. Put\nanother way, even though we’re not capable of spending a full day in a state\nof blissful depth, this reality shouldn’t reduce the urgency of reducing\nshallow work, as the typical knowledge workday is more easily fragmented\nthan many suspect.\nTo summarize, I’m asking you to treat shallow work with suspicion\nbecause its damage is often vastly underestimated and its importance vastly\noverestimated. This type of work is inevitable, but you must keep it\nconfined to a point where it doesn’t impede your ability to take full\nadvantage of the deeper efforts that ultimately determine your impact. The\nstrategies that follow will help you act on this reality.\nSchedule Every Minute of Your Day\nIf you’re between the ages of twenty-five and thirty-four years old and live\nin Britain, you likely watch more television than you realize. In 2013, the\nBritish TV licensing authority surveyed television watchers about their\nhabits. The twenty-five-to thirty-four-year-olds taking the survey estimated\nthat they spend somewhere between fifteen and sixteen hours per week\nwatching TV. This sounds like a lot, but it’s actually a significant\nunderestimate. We know this because when it comes to television-watching\nhabits, we have access to the ground truth. The Broadcasters’ Audience\nResearch Board (the British equivalent of the American Nielsen Company)\nplaces meters in a representative sample of households. These meters\nrecord, without bias or wishful thinking, exactly how much people actually\nwatch. The twenty-five-to thirty-four-year-olds who thought they watched\nfifteen hours a week, it turns out, watch more like twenty-eight hours.\nThis bad estimate of time usage is not unique to British television\nwatching. When you consider different groups self-estimating different\nbehaviors, similar gaps stubbornly remain. In a Wall Street Journal article\non the topic, business writer Laura Vanderkam pointed out several more\nsuch examples. A survey by the National Sleep Foundation revealed that\nAmericans think they’re sleeping, on average, somewhere around seven\nhours a night. The American Time Use Survey, which has people actually\nmeasure their sleep, corrected this number to 8.6 hours. Another study\nfound that people who claimed to work sixty to sixty-four hours per week\nwere actually averaging more like forty-four hours per week, while those\nclaiming to work more than seventy-five hours were actually working less\nthan fifty-five.\nThese examples underscore an important point: We spend much of our\nday on autopilot—not giving much thought to what we’re doing with our\ntime. This is a problem. It’s difficult to prevent the trivial from creeping into\nevery corner of your schedule if you don’t face, without flinching, your\ncurrent balance between deep and shallow work, and then adopt the habit of\npausing before action and asking, “What makes the most sense right now?”\nThe strategy described in the following paragraphs is designed to force you\ninto these behaviors. It’s an idea that might seem extreme at first but will\nsoon prove indispensable in your quest to take full advantage of the value of\ndeep work: Schedule every minute of your day.\nHere’s my suggestion: At the beginning of each workday, turn to a new\npage of lined paper in a notebook you dedicate to this purpose. Down the\nleft-hand side of the page, mark every other line with an hour of the day,\ncovering the full set of hours you typically work. Now comes the important\npart: Divide the hours of your workday into blocks and assign activities to\nthe blocks. For example, you might block off nine a.m. to eleven a.m. for\nwriting a client’s press release. To do so, actually draw a box that covers the\nlines corresponding to these hours, then write “press release” inside the box.\nNot every block need be dedicated to a work task. There might be time\nblocks for lunch or relaxation breaks. To keep things reasonably clean, the\nminimum length of a block should be thirty minutes (i.e., one line on your\npage). This means, for example, that instead of having a unique small box\nfor each small task on your plate for the day—respond to boss’s e-mail,\nsubmit reimbursement form, ask Carl about report—you can batch similar\nthings into more generic task blocks. You might find it useful, in this case,\nto draw a line from a task block to the open right-hand side of the page\nwhere you can list out the full set of small tasks you plan to accomplish in\nthat block.\nWhen you’re done scheduling your day, every minute should be part of a\nblock. You have, in effect, given every minute of your workday a job. Now\nas you go through your day, use this schedule to guide you.\nIt’s here, of course, that most people will begin to run into trouble. Two\nthings can (and likely will) go wrong with your schedule once the day\nprogresses. The first is that your estimates will prove wrong. You might put\naside two hours for writing a press release, for example, and in reality it\ntakes two and a half hours. The second problem is that you’ll be interrupted\nand new obligations will unexpectedly appear on your plate. These events\nwill also break your schedule.\nThis is okay. If your schedule is disrupted, you should, at the next\navailable moment, take a few minutes to create a revised schedule for the\ntime that remains in the day. You can turn to a new page. You can erase and\nredraw blocks. Or do as I do: Cross out the blocks for the remainder of the\nday and create new blocks to the right of the old ones on the page (I draw\nmy blocks skinny so I have room for several revisions). On some days, you\nmight rewrite your schedule half a dozen times. Don’t despair if this\nhappens. Your goal is not to stick to a given schedule at all costs; it’s\ninstead to maintain, at all times, a thoughtful say in what you’re doing with\nyour time going forward—even if these decisions are reworked again and\nagain as the day unfolds.\nIf you find that schedule revisions become overwhelming in their\nfrequency, there are a few tactics that can inject some more stability. First,\nyou should recognize that almost definitely you’re going to underestimate at\nfirst how much time you require for most things. When people are new to\nthis habit, they tend to use their schedule as an incarnation of wishful\nthinking—a best-case scenario for their day. Over time, you should make an\neffort to accurately (if not somewhat conservatively) predict the time tasks\nwill require.\nThe second tactic that helps is the use of overflow conditional blocks. If\nyou’re not sure how long a given activity might take, block off the expected\ntime, then follow this with an additional block that has a split purpose. If\nyou need more time for the preceding activity, use this additional block to\nkeep working on it. If you finish the activity on time, however, have an\nalternate use already assigned for the extra block (for example, some\nnonurgent tasks). This allows unpredictability in your day without requiring\nyou to keep changing your schedule on paper. For example, returning to our\npress release example, you might schedule two hours for writing the press\nrelease, but then follow it by an additional hour block that you can use to\nkeep writing the release, if needed, but otherwise assign to catching up with\ne-mail.\nThe third tactic I suggest is to be liberal with your use of task blocks.\nDeploy many throughout your day and make them longer than required to\nhandle the tasks you plan in the morning. Lots of things come up during the\ntypical knowledge worker’s day: Having regularly occurring blocks of time\nto address these surprises keeps things running smoothly.\nBefore leaving you to put this strategy in practice, I should address a\ncommon objection. In my experience pitching the values of daily schedules,\nI’ve found that many people worry that this level of planning will become\nburdensomely restrictive. Here, for example, is part of a comment from a\nreader named Joseph on a blog post I wrote on this topic:\nI think you far understate the role of uncertainty… I [worry about]\nreaders applying these observations too seriously, to the point of an\nobsessive (and unhealthy) relationship with one’s schedule that\nseems to exaggerate the importance of minute-counting over getting-\nlost-in-activities, which if we’re talking about artists is often the only\nreally sensible course of action.\nI understand these concerns, and Joseph is certainly not the first to raise\nthem. Fortunately, however, they’re also easily addressed. In my own daily\nscheduling discipline, in addition to regularly scheduling significant blocks\nof time for speculative thinking and discussion, I maintain a rule that if I\nstumble onto an important insight, then this is a perfectly valid reason to\nignore the rest of my schedule for the day (with the exception, of course, of\nthings that cannot be skipped). I can then stick with this unexpected insight\nuntil it loses steam. At this point, I’ll step back and rebuild my schedule for\nany time that remains in the day.\nIn other words, I not only allow spontaneity in my schedule; I encourage\nit. Joseph’s critique is driven by the mistaken idea that the goal of a\nschedule is to force your behavior into a rigid plan. This type of scheduling,\nhowever, isn’t about constraint—it’s instead about thoughtfulness. It’s a\nsimple habit that forces you to continually take a moment throughout your\nday and ask: “What makes sense for me to do with the time that remains?”\nIt’s the habit of asking that returns results, not your unyielding fidelity to\nthe answer.\nI would go so far as to argue that someone following this combination of\ncomprehensive scheduling and a willingness to adapt or modify the plan as\nneeded will likely experience more creative insights than someone who\nadopts a more traditionally “spontaneous” approach where the day is left\nopen and unstructured. Without structure, it’s easy to allow your time to\ndevolve into the shallow—e-mail, social media, Web surfing. This type of\nshallow behavior, though satisfying in the moment, is not conducive to\ncreativity. With structure, on the other hand, you can ensure that you\nregularly schedule blocks to grapple with a new idea, or work deeply on\nsomething challenging, or brainstorm for a fixed period—the type of\ncommitment more likely to instigate innovation. (Recall, for example, the\ndiscussion in Rule #1 about the rigid rituals followed by many great\ncreative thinkers.) And because you’re willing to abandon your plan when\nan innovative idea arises, you’re just as well suited as the distracted creative\nto follow up when the muse strikes.\nTo summarize, the motivation for this strategy is the recognition that a deep\nwork habit requires you to treat your time with respect. A good first step\ntoward this respectful handling is the advice outlined here: Decide in\nadvance what you’re going to do with every minute of your workday. It’s\nnatural, at first, to resist this idea, as it’s undoubtedly easier to continue to\nallow the twin forces of internal whim and external requests to drive your\nschedule. But you must overcome this distrust of structure if you want to\napproach your true potential as someone who creates things that matter.\nQuantify the Depth of Every Activity\nAn advantage of scheduling your day is that you can determine how much\ntime you’re actually spending in shallow activities. Extracting this insight\nfrom your schedules, however, can become tricky in practice, as it’s not\nalways clear exactly how shallow you should consider a given task. To\nexpand on this challenge, let’s start by reminding ourselves of the formal\ndefinition of shallow work that I introduced in the introduction:\nShallow Work: Noncognitively demanding, logistical-style tasks, often performed while\ndistracted. These efforts tend not to create much new value in the world and are easy to\nreplicate.\nSome activities clearly satisfy this definition. Checking e-mail, for\nexample, or scheduling a conference call, is unquestionably shallow in\nnature. But the classification of other activities can be more ambiguous.\nConsider the following tasks:\n• Example #1: Editing a draft of an academic article that you and a\ncollaborator will soon submit to a journal.\n• Example #2: Building a PowerPoint presentation about this quarter’s\nsales figures.\n• Example #3: Attending a meeting to discuss the current status of an\nimportant project and to agree on the next steps.\nIt’s not obvious at first how to categorize these examples. The first two\ndescribe tasks that can be quite demanding, and the final example seems\nimportant to advance a key work objective. The purpose of this strategy is\nto give you an accurate metric for resolving such ambiguity—providing you\nwith a way to make clear and consistent decisions about where given work\ntasks fall on the shallow-to-deep scale. To do so, it asks that you evaluate\nactivities by asking a simple (but surprisingly illuminating) question:\nHow long would it take (in months) to train a smart recent college graduate with no\nspecialized training in my field to complete this task?\nTo illustrate this approach, let’s apply this question to our examples of\nambiguous tasks.\n• Analyzing Example #1: To properly edit an academic paper requires\nthat you understand the nuances of the work (so you can make sure it’s\nbeing described precisely) and the nuances of the broader literature (so you\ncan make sure it’s being cited properly). These requirements require\ncutting-edge knowledge of an academic field—a task that in the age of\nspecialization takes years of diligent study at the graduate level and beyond.\nWhen it comes to this example, the answer to our question would therefore\nbe quite large, perhaps on the scale of fifty to seventy-five months.\n• Analyzing Example #2: The second example doesn’t fare so well by\nthis analysis. To create a PowerPoint presentation that describes your\nquarterly sales requires three things: first, knowledge of how to make a\nPowerPoint presentation; second, an understanding of the standard format\nof these quarterly performance presentations within your organization; and\nthird, an understanding of what sales metrics your organization tracks and\nhow to convert them into the right graphs. The hypothetical college\ngraduate imagined by our question, we can assume, would already know\nhow to use PowerPoint, and learning the standard format for your\norganization’s presentations shouldn’t require more than a week. The real\nquestion, therefore, is how long it takes a bright college graduate to\nunderstand the metrics you track, where to find the results, and how to clean\nthose up and translate them into graphs and charts that are appropriate for a\nslide presentation. This isn’t a trivial task, but for a bright college grad it\nwouldn’t require more than an additional month or so of training—so we\ncan use two months as our conservative answer.\n• Analyzing Example #3: Meetings can be tricky to analyze. They can\nseem tedious at times but they’re often also presented as playing a key role\nin your organization’s most important activities. The method presented here\nhelps cut through this veneer. How long would it take to train a bright\nrecent college graduate to take your place in a planning meeting? He or she\nwould have to understand the project well enough to know its milestones\nand the skills of its participants. Our hypothetical grad might also need\nsome insight into the interpersonal dynamics and the reality of how such\nprojects are executed at the organization. At this point, you might wonder if\nthis college grad would also need a deep expertise in the topic tackled by\nthe project. For a planning meeting—probably not. Such meetings rarely\ndive into substantive content and tend to feature a lot of small talk and\nposturing in which participants try to make it seem like they’re committing\nto a lot without actually having to commit. Give a bright recent graduate\nthree months to learn the ropes and he or she could take your place without\nissue in such a gabfest. So we’ll use three months as our answer.\nThis question is meant as a thought experiment (I’m not going to ask\nyou to actually hire a recent college graduate to take over tasks that score\nlow). But the answers it provides will help you objectively quantify the\nshallowness or depth of various activities. If our hypothetical college\ngraduate requires many months of training to replicate a task, then this\nindicates that the task leverages hard-won expertise. As argued earlier, tasks\nthat leverage your expertise tend to be deep tasks and they can therefore\nprovide a double benefit: They return more value per time spent, and they\nstretch your abilities, leading to improvement. On the other hand, a task that\nour hypothetical college graduate can pick up quickly is one that does not\nleverage expertise, and therefore it can be understood as shallow.\nWhat should you do with this strategy? Once you know where your\nactivities fall on the deep-to-shallow scale, bias your time toward the\nformer. When we reconsider our case studies, for example, we see that the\nfirst task is something that you would want to prioritize as a good use of\ntime, while the second and third are activities of a type that should be\nminimized—they might feel productive, but their return on (time)\ninvestment is measly.\nOf course, how one biases away from shallow and toward depth is not\nalways obvious—even after you know how to accurately label your\ncommitments. This brings us to the strategies that follow, which will\nprovide specific guidance on how to accomplish this tricky goal.\nAsk Your Boss for a Shallow Work Budget\nHere’s an important question that’s rarely asked: What percentage of my\ntime should be spent on shallow work? This strategy suggests that you ask\nit. If you have a boss, in other words, have a conversation about this\nquestion. (You’ll probably have to first define for him or her what\n“shallow” and “deep” work means.) If you work for yourself, ask yourself\nthis question. In both cases, settle on a specific answer. Then—and this is\nthe important part—try to stick to this budget. (The strategies that precede\nand follow this one will help you achieve this goal.)\nFor most people in most non-entry-level knowledge work jobs, the\nanswer to the question will be somewhere in the 30 to 50 percent range\n(there’s a psychological distaste surrounding the idea of spending the\nmajority of your time on unskilled tasks, so 50 percent is a natural upper\nlimit, while at the same time most bosses will begin to worry that if this\npercentage gets too much lower than 30 percent you’ll be reduced to a\nknowledge work hermit who thinks big thoughts but never responds to e-\nmails).\nObeying this budget will likely require changes to your behavior. You’ll\nalmost certainly end up forced into saying no to projects that seem infused\nwith shallowness while also more aggressively reducing the amount of\nshallowness in your existing projects. This budget might lead you to drop\nthe need for a weekly status meeting in preference for results-driven\nreporting (“let me know when you’ve made significant progress; then we’ll\ntalk”). It might also lead you to start spending more mornings in\ncommunication isolation or decide it’s not as important as you once thought\nto respond quickly and in detail to every cc’d e-mail that crosses your\ninbox.\nThese changes are all positive for your quest to make deep work central\nto your working life. On the one hand, they don’t ask you to abandon your\ncore shallow obligations—a move that would cause problems and\nresentment—as you’re still spending a lot of time on such efforts. On the\nother hand, they do force you to place a hard limit on the amount of less\nurgent obligations you allow to slip insidiously into your schedule. This\nlimit frees up space for significant amounts of deep effort on a consistent\nbasis.\nThe reason why these decisions should start with a conversation with\nyour boss is that this agreement establishes implicit support from your\nworkplace. If you work for someone else, this strategy provides cover when\nyou turn down an obligation or restructure a project to minimize\nshallowness. You can justify the move because it’s necessary for you to hit\nyour prescribed target mix of work types. As I discussed in Chapter 2, part\nof the reason shallow work persists in large quantities in knowledge work is\nthat we rarely see the total impact of such efforts on our schedules. We\ninstead tend to evaluate these behaviors one by one in the moment—a\nperspective from which each task can seem quite reasonable and\nconvenient. The tools from earlier in this rule, however, allow you to make\nthis impact explicit. You can now confidently say to your boss, “This is the\nexact percentage of my time spent last week on shallow work,” and force\nhim or her to give explicit approval for that ratio. Faced with these\nnumbers, and the economic reality they clarify (it’s incredibly wasteful, for\nexample, to pay a highly trained professional to send e-mail messages and\nattend meetings for thirty hours a week), a boss will be led to the natural\nconclusion that you need to say no to some things and to streamline others\n—even if this makes life less convenient for the boss, or for you, or for your\ncoworkers. Because, of course, in the end, a business’s goal is to generate\nvalue, not to make sure its employees’ lives are as easy as possible.\nIf you work for yourself, this exercise will force you to confront the\nreality of how little time in your “busy” schedule you’re actually producing\nvalue. These hard numbers will provide you the confidence needed to start\nscaling back on the shallow activities that are sapping your time. Without\nthese numbers, it’s difficult for an entrepreneur to say no to any opportunity\nthat might generate some positive return. “I have to be on Twitter!,” “I have\nto maintain an active Facebook presence!,” “I have to tweak the widgets on\nmy blog!,” you tell yourself, because when considered in isolation, to say\nno to any one of these activities seems like you’re being lazy. By instead\npicking and sticking with a shallow-to-deep ratio, you can replace this guilt-\ndriven unconditional acceptance with the more healthy habit of trying to get\nthe most out of the time you put aside for shallow work (therefore still\nexposing yourself to many opportunities), but keeping these efforts\nconstrained to a small enough fraction of your time and attention to enable\nthe deep work that ultimately drives your business forward.\nOf course, there’s always the possibility that when you ask this question\nthe answer is stark. No boss will explicitly answer, “One hundred percent of\nyour time should be shallow!” (unless you’re entry level, at which point you\nneed to delay this exercise until you’ve built enough skills to add deep\nefforts to your official work responsibilities), but a boss might reply, in so\nmany words, “as much shallow work as is needed for you to promptly do\nwhatever we need from you at the moment.” In this case, the answer is still\nuseful, as it tells you that this isn’t a job that supports deep work, and a job\nthat doesn’t support deep work is not a job that can help you succeed in our\ncurrent information economy. You should, in this case, thank the boss for\nthe feedback, and then promptly start planning how you can transition into a\nnew position that values depth.\nFinish Your Work by Five Thirty\nIn the seven days preceding my first writing these words, I participated in\nsixty-five different e-mail conversations. Among these sixty-five\nconversations, I sent exactly five e-mails after five thirty p.m. The\nimmediate story told by these statistics is that, with few exceptions, I don’t\nsend e-mails after five thirty. But given how intertwined e-mail has become\nwith work in general, there’s a more surprising reality hinted by this\nbehavior: I don’t work after five thirty p.m.\nI call this commitment fixed-schedule productivity, as I fix the firm goal\nof not working past a certain time, then work backward to find productivity\nstrategies that allow me to satisfy this declaration. I’ve practiced fixed-\nschedule productivity happily for more than half a decade now, and it’s\nbeen crucial to my efforts to build a productive professional life centered on\ndeep work. In the pages ahead, I will try to convince you to adopt this\nstrategy as well.\nLet me start my pitch for fixed-schedule productivity by first noting that,\naccording to conventional wisdom, in the academic world I inhabit this\ntactic should fail. Professors—especially junior professors—are notorious\nfor adopting grueling schedules that extend into the night and through\nweekends. Consider, for example, a blog post published by a young\ncomputer science professor whom I’ll call “Tom.” In this post, which Tom\nwrote in the winter of 2014, he replicates his schedule for a recent day in\nwhich he spent twelve hours at his office. This schedule includes five\ndifferent meetings and three hours of “administrative” tasks, which he\ndescribes as “tending to bushels of e-mails, filling out bureaucratic forms,\norganizing meeting notes, planning future meetings.” By his estimation, he\nspent only one and a half out of the twelve total hours sitting in his office\ntackling “real” work, which he defines as efforts that make progress toward\na “research deliverable.” It’s no wonder that Tom feels coerced into\nworking well beyond the standard workday. “I’ve already accepted the\nreality that I’ll be working on weekends,” he concludes in another post.\n“Very few junior faculty can avoid such a fate.”\nAnd yet, I have. Even though I don’t work at night and rarely work on\nweekends, between arriving at Georgetown in the fall of 2011 and\nbeginning work on this chapter in the fall of 2014, I’ve published\nsomewhere around twenty peer-reviewed articles. I also won two\ncompetitive grants, published one (nonacademic) book, and have almost\nfinished writing another (which you’re reading at the moment). All while\navoiding the grueling schedules deemed necessary by the Toms of the\nworld.\nWhat explains this paradox? We can find a compelling answer in a\nwidely disseminated article published in 2013 by an academic further along\nin her career, and far more accomplished than I: Radhika Nagpal, the Fred\nKavli Professor of Computer Science at Harvard University. Nagpal opens\nthe article by claiming that much of the stress suffered by tenure-track\nprofessors is self-imposed. “Scary myths and scary data abound about life\nas a tenure-track faculty at an ‘R1’ [research-focused] university,” she\nbegins, before continuing to explain how she finally decided to disregard\nthe conventional wisdom and instead “deliberately… do specific things to\npreserve my happiness.” This deliberate effort led Nagpal to enjoy her pre-\ntenure time “tremendously.”\nNagpal goes on to detail several examples of these efforts, but there’s\none tactic in particular that should sound familiar. As Nagpal admits, early\nin her academic career she found herself trying to cram work into every free\nhour between seven a.m. and midnight (because she has kids, this time,\nespecially in the evening, was often severely fractured). It didn’t take long\nbefore she decided this strategy was unsustainable, so she set a limit of fifty\nhours a week and worked backward to determine what rules and habits\nwere needed to satisfy this constraint. Nagpal, in other words, deployed\nfixed-schedule productivity.\nWe know this strategy didn’t hurt her academic career, as she ended up\nearning tenure on schedule and then jumping to the full professor level after\nonly three additional years (an impressive ascent). How did she pull this\noff? According to her article, one of the main techniques for respecting her\nhour limit was to set drastic quotas on the major sources of shallow\nendeavors in her academic life. For example, she decided she would travel\nonly five times per year for any purpose, as trips can generate a surprisingly\nlarge load of urgent shallow obligations (from making lodging\narrangements to writing talks). Five trips a year may still sound like a lot,\nbut for an academic it’s light. To emphasize this point, note that Matt\nWelsh, a former colleague of Nagpal in the Harvard computer science\ndepartment (he now works for Google) once wrote a blog post in which he\nclaimed it was typical for junior faculty to travel twelve to twenty-four\ntimes a year. (Imagine the shallow efforts Nagpal avoided in sidestepping\nan extra ten to fifteen trips!) The travel quota is just one of several tactics\nthat Nagpal used to control her workday (she also, for example, placed\nlimits on the number of papers she would review per year), but what all her\ntactics shared was a commitment to ruthlessly capping the shallow while\nprotecting the deep efforts—that is, original research—that ultimately\ndetermined her professional fate.\nReturning to my own example, it’s a similar commitment that enables\nme to succeed with fixed scheduling. I, too, am incredibly cautious about\nmy use of the most dangerous word in one’s productivity vocabulary: “yes.”\nIt takes a lot to convince me to agree to something that yields shallow work.\nIf you ask for my involvement in university business that’s not absolutely\nnecessary, I might respond with a defense I learned from the department\nchair who hired me: “Talk to me after tenure.” Another tactic that works\nwell for me is to be clear in my refusal but ambiguous in my explanation for\nthe refusal. The key is to avoid providing enough specificity about the\nexcuse that the requester has the opportunity to defuse it. If, for example, I\nturn down a time-consuming speaking invitation with the excuse that I have\nother trips scheduled for around the same time, I don’t provide details—\nwhich might leave the requester the ability to suggest a way to fit his or her\nevent into my existing obligations—but instead just say, “Sounds\ninteresting, but I can’t make it due to schedule conflicts.” In turning down\nobligations, I also resist the urge to offer a consolation prize that ends up\ndevouring almost as much of my schedule (e.g., “Sorry I can’t join your\ncommittee, but I’m happy to take a look at some of your proposals as they\ncome together and offer my thoughts”). A clean break is best.\nIn addition to carefully guarding my obligations, I’m incredibly\nconscientious about managing my time. Because my time is limited each\nday, I cannot afford to allow a large deadline to creep up on me, or a\nmorning to be wasted on something trivial, because I didn’t take a moment\nto craft a smart plan. The Damoclean cap on the workday enforced by\nfixed-schedule productivity has a way of keeping my organization efforts\nsharp. Without this looming cutoff, I’d likely end up more lax in my habits.\nTo summarize these observations, Nagpal and I can both succeed in\nacademia without Tom-style overload due to two reasons. First, we’re\nasymmetric in the culling forced by our fixed-schedule commitment. By\nruthlessly reducing the shallow while preserving the deep, this strategy\nfrees up our time without diminishing the amount of new value we\ngenerate. Indeed, I would go so far as to argue that the reduction in shallow\nfrees up more energy for the deep alternative, allowing us to produce more\nthan if we had defaulted to a more typical crowded schedule. Second, the\nlimits to our time necessitate more careful thinking about our organizational\nhabits, also leading to more value produced as compared to longer but less\norganized schedules.\nThe key claim of this strategy is that these same benefits hold for most\nknowledge work fields. That is, even if you’re not a professor, fixed-\nschedule productivity can yield powerful benefits. In most knowledge work\njobs, it can be difficult in the moment to turn down a shallow commitment\nthat seems harmless in isolation—be it accepting an invitation to get coffee\nor agreeing to “jump on a call.” A commitment to fixed-schedule\nproductivity, however, shifts you into a scarcity mind-set. Suddenly any\nobligation beyond your deepest efforts is suspect and seen as potentially\ndisruptive. Your default answer becomes no, the bar for gaining access to\nyour time and attention rises precipitously, and you begin to organize the\nefforts that pass these obstacles with a ruthless efficiency. It might also lead\nyou to test assumptions about your company’s work culture that you\nthought were ironclad but turn out to be malleable. It’s common, for\nexample, to receive e-mails from your boss after hours. Fixed-schedule\nproductivity would have you ignore these messages until the next morning.\nMany suspect that this would cause problems, as such responses are\nexpected, but in many cases, the fact that your boss happens to be clearing\nher inbox at night doesn’t mean that she expects an immediate response—a\nlesson this strategy would soon help you discover.\nFixed-schedule productivity, in other words, is a meta-habit that’s\nsimple to adopt but broad in its impact. If you have to choose just one\nbehavior that reorients your focus toward the deep, this one should be high\non your list of possibilities. If you’re still not sure, however, about the idea\nthat artificial limits on your workday can make you more successful, I urge\nyou to once again turn your attention to the career of fixed-schedule\nadvocate Radhika Nagpal. In a satisfying coincidence, at almost the exact\nsame time that Tom was lamenting online about his unavoidably intense\nworkload as a young professor, Nagpal was celebrating the latest of the\nmany professional triumphs she has experienced despite her fixed schedule:\nHer research was featured on the cover of the journal Science.\nBecome Hard to Reach\nNo discussion of shallow work is complete without considering e-mail. This\nquintessential shallow activity is particularly insidious in its grip on most\nknowledge workers’ attention, as it delivers a steady stream of distractions\naddressed specifically to you. Ubiquitous e-mail access has become so\ningrained in our professional habits that we’re beginning to lose the sense\nthat we have any say in its role in our life. As John Freeman warns in his\n2009 book, The Tyranny of E-mail, with the rise of this technology “we are\nslowly eroding our ability to explain—in a careful, complex way—why it is\nso wrong for us to complain, resist, or redesign our workdays so that they\nare manageable.” E-mail seems a fait accompli. Resistance is futile.\nThis strategy pushes back at this fatalism. Just because you cannot avoid\nthis tool altogether doesn’t mean you have to cede all authority over its role\nin your mental landscape. In the following sections I describe three tips that\nwill help you regain authority over how this technology accesses your time\nand attention, and arrest the erosion of autonomy identified by Freeman.\nResistance is not futile: You have more control over your electronic\ncommunication than you might at first assume.\nTip #1: Make People Who Send You E-mail Do More Work\nMost nonfiction authors are easy to reach. They include an e-mail address\non their author websites along with an open invitation to send them any\nrequest or suggestion that comes to mind. Many even encourage this\nfeedback as a necessary commitment to the elusive but much-touted\nimportance of “community building” among their readers. But here’s the\nthing: I don’t buy it.\nIf you visit the contact page on my author website, there’s no general-\npurpose e-mail address. Instead, I list different individuals you can contact\nfor specific purposes: my literary agent for rights requests, for example, or\nmy speaking agent for speaking requests. If you want to reach me, I offer\nonly a special-purpose e-mail address that comes with conditions and a\nlowered expectation that I’ll respond:\nIf you have an offer, opportunity, or introduction that might make my\nlife more interesting, e-mail me at interesting [at] calnewport.com.\nFor the reasons stated above, I’ll only respond to those proposals\nthat are a good match for my schedule and interests.\nI call this approach a sender filter, as I’m asking my correspondents to\nfilter themselves before attempting to contact me. This filter has\nsignificantly reduced the time I spend in my inbox. Before I began using a\nsender filter, I had a standard general-purpose e-mail address listed on my\nwebsite. Not surprisingly, I used to receive a large volume of long e-mails\nasking for advice on specific (and often quite complicated) student or career\nquestions. I like to help individuals, but these requests became\noverwhelming—they didn’t take the senders long to craft but they would\nrequire a lot of explanation and writing on my part to respond. My sender\nfilter has eliminated most such communication, and in doing so, has\ndrastically reduced the number of messages I encounter in my writing\ninbox. As for my own interest in helping my readers, I now redirect this\nenergy toward settings I carefully choose to maximize impact. Instead of\nallowing any student in the world to send me a question, for example, I now\nwork closely with a small number of student groups where I’m quite\naccessible and can offer more substantial and effective mentoring.\nAnother benefit of a sender filter is that it resets expectations. The most\ncrucial line in my description is the following: “I’ll only respond to those\nproposals that are a good match for my schedule and interests.” This seems\nminor, but it makes a substantial difference in how my correspondents think\nabout their messages to me. The default social convention surrounding e-\nmail is that unless you’re famous, if someone sends you something, you\nowe him or her a response. For most, therefore, an inbox full of messages\ngenerates a major sense of obligation.\nBy instead resetting your correspondents’ expectations to the reality that\nyou’ll probably not respond, the experience is transformed. The inbox is\nnow a collection of opportunities that you can glance at when you have the\nfree time—seeking out those that make sense for you to engage. But the\npile of unread messages no longer generates a sense of obligation. You\ncould, if you wanted to, ignore them all, and nothing bad would happen.\nPsychologically, this can be freeing.\nI worried when I first began using a sender filter that it would seem\npretentious—as if my time was more valuable than that of my readers—and\nthat it would upset people. But this fear wasn’t realized. Most people easily\naccept the idea that you have a right to control your own incoming\ncommunication, as they would like to enjoy this same right. More\nimportant, people appreciate clarity. Most are okay to not receive a response\nif they don’t expect one (in general, those with a minor public presence,\nsuch as authors, overestimate how much people really care about their\nreplies to their messages).\nIn some cases, this expectation reset might even earn you more credit\nwhen you do respond. For example, an editor of an online publication once\nsent me a guest post opportunity with the assumption, set by my filter, that I\nwould likely not respond. When I did, it proved a happy surprise. Here’s her\nsummary of the interaction:\nSo, when I emailed Cal to ask if he wanted to contribute to [the\npublication], my expectations were set. He didn’t have anything on\nhis [sender filter] about wanting to guest blog, so there wouldn’t\nhave been any hard feelings if I’d never heard a peep. Then, when he\ndid respond, I was thrilled.\nMy particular sender filter is just one example of this general strategy.\nConsider consultant Clay Herbert, who is an expert in running crowd-\nfunding campaigns for technology start-ups: a specialty that attracts a lot of\ncorrespondents hoping to glean some helpful advice. As a Forbes.com\narticle on sender filters reports, “At some point, the number of people\nreaching out exceeded [Herbert’s] capacity, so he created filters that put the\nonus on the person asking for help.”\nThough he started from a similar motivation as me, Herbert’s filters\nended up taking a different form. To contact him, you must first consult an\nFAQ to make sure your question has not already been answered (which was\nthe case for a lot of the messages Herbert was processing before his filters\nwere in place). If you make it through this FAQ sieve, he then asks you to\nfill out a survey that allows him to further screen for connections that seem\nparticularly relevant to his expertise. For those who make it past this step,\nHerbert enforces a small fee you must pay before communicating with him.\nThis fee is not about making extra money, but is instead about selecting for\nindividuals who are serious about receiving and acting on advice. Herbert’s\nfilters still enable him to help people and encounter interesting\nopportunities. But at the same time, they have reduced his incoming\ncommunication to a level he can easily handle.\nTo give another example, consider Antonio Centeno, who runs the\npopular Real Man Style blog. Centeno’s sender filter lays out a two-step\nprocess. If you have a question, he diverts you to a public location to post it.\nCenteno thinks it’s wasteful to answer the same questions again and again\nin private one-on-one conversations. If you make it past this step, he then\nmakes you commit to, by clicking check boxes, the following three\npromises:\n I am not asking Antonio a style question I could find searching\nGoogle for 10 minutes.\n I am not SPAMMING Antonio with a cut-and-pasting generic\nrequest to promote my unrelated business.\n I will do a good deed for some random stranger if Antonio responds\nwithin 23 hours.\nThe message box in which you can type your message doesn’t appear on\nthe contact page until after you’ve clicked the box by all three promises.\nTo summarize, the technologies underlying e-mail are transformative,\nbut the current social conventions guiding how we apply this technology are\nunderdeveloped. The notion that all messages, regardless of purpose or\nsender, arrive in the same undifferentiated inbox, and that there’s an\nexpectation that every message deserves a (timely) response, is absurdly\nunproductive. The sender filter is a small but useful step toward a better\nstate of affairs, and is an idea whose time has come—at least for the\nincreasing number of entrepreneurs and freelancers who both receive a lot\nof incoming communication and have the ability to dictate their\naccessibility. (I’d also love to see similar rules become ubiquitous for intra-\noffice communication in large organizations, but for the reasons argued in\nChapter 2, we’re probably a long way from that reality.) If you’re in a\nposition to do so, consider sender filters as a way of reclaiming some\ncontrol over your time and attention.\nTip #2: Do More Work When You Send or Reply to E-mails\nConsider the following standard e-mails:\nE-mail #1: “It was great to meet you last week. I’d love to follow up on\nsome of those issues we discussed. Do you want to grab coffee?”\nE-mail #2: “We should get back to the research problem we discussed\nduring my last visit. Remind me where we are with that?”\nE-mail #3: “I took a stab at that article we discussed. It’s attached.\nThoughts?”\nThese three examples should be familiar to most knowledge workers, as\nthey’re representative of many of the messages that fill their inboxes.\nThey’re also potential productivity land mines: How you respond to them\nwill have a significant impact on how much time and attention the resulting\nconversation ultimately consumes.\nIn particular, interrogative e-mails like these generate an initial instinct\nto dash off the quickest possible response that will clear the message—\ntemporarily—out of your inbox. A quick response will, in the short term,\nprovide you with some minor relief because you’re bouncing the\nresponsibility implied by the message off your court and back onto the\nsender’s. This relief, however, is short-lived, as this responsibility will\ncontinue to bounce back again and again, continually sapping your time and\nattention. I suggest, therefore, that the right strategy when faced with a\nquestion of this type is to pause a moment before replying and take the time\nto answer the following key prompt:\nWhat is the project represented by this message, and what is the most\nefficient (in terms of messages generated) process for bringing this\nproject to a successful conclusion?\nOnce you’ve answered this question for yourself, replace a quick\nresponse with one that takes the time to describe the process you identified,\npoints out the current step, and emphasizes the step that comes next. I call\nthis the process-centric approach to e-mail, and it’s designed to minimize\nboth the number of e-mails you receive and the amount of mental clutter\nthey generate.\nTo better explain this process and why it works consider the following\nprocess-centric responses to the sample e-mails from earlier:\nProcess-Centric Response to E-mail #1: “I’d love to grab coffee. Let’s\nmeet at the Starbucks on campus. Below I listed two days next week when\nI’m free. For each day, I listed three times. If any of those day and time\ncombinations work for you, let me know. I’ll consider your reply\nconfirmation for the meeting. If none of those date and time combinations\nwork, give me a call at the number below and we’ll hash out a time that\nworks. Looking forward to it.”\nProcess-Centric Response to E-mail #2: “I agree that we should return to\nthis problem. Here’s what I suggest…\n“Sometime in the next week e-mail me everything you remember about\nour discussion on the problem. Once I receive that message, I’ll start a\nshared directory for the project and add to it a document that summarizes\nwhat you sent me, combined with my own memory of our past discussion.\nIn the document, I’ll highlight the two or three most promising next steps.\n“We can then take a crack at those next steps for a few weeks and check\nback in. I suggest we schedule a phone call for a month from now for this\npurpose. Below I listed some dates and times when I’m available for a call.\nWhen you respond with your notes, indicate the date and time combination\nthat works best for you and we’ll consider that reply confirmation for the\ncall. I look forward to digging into this problem.”\nProcess-Centric Response to E-mail #3: “Thanks for getting back to me.\nI’m going to read this draft of the article and send you back an edited\nversion annotated with comments on Friday (the 10th). In this version I\nsend back, I’ll edit what I can do myself, and add comments to draw your\nattention to places where I think you’re better suited to make the\nimprovement. At that point, you should have what you need to polish and\nsubmit the final draft, so I’ll leave you to do that—no need to reply to this\nmessage or to follow up with me after I return the edits—unless, of course,\nthere’s an issue.”\nIn crafting these sample responses, I started by identifying the project\nimplied by the message. Notice, the word “project” is used loosely here. It\ncan cover things that are large and obviously projects, such as making\nprogress on a research problem (Example #2), but it applies just as easily to\nsmall logistical challenges like setting up a coffee meeting (Example #1). I\nthen took a minute or two to think through a process that gets us from the\ncurrent state to a desired outcome with a minimum of messages required.\nThe final step was to write a reply that clearly describes this process and\nwhere we stand. These examples centered on an e-mail reply, but it should\nbe clear that a similar approach also works when writing an e-mail message\nfrom scratch.\nThe process-centric approach to e-mail can significantly mitigate the\nimpact of this technology on your time and attention. There are two reasons\nfor this effect. First, it reduces the number of e-mails in your inbox—\nsometimes significantly (something as simple as scheduling a coffee\nmeeting can easily spiral into half a dozen or more messages over a period\nof many days, if you’re not careful about your replies). This, in turn,\nreduces the time you spend in your inbox and reduces the brainpower you\nmust expend when you do.\nSecond, to steal terminology from David Allen, a good process-centric\nmessage immediately “closes the loop” with respect to the project at hand.\nWhen a project is initiated by an e-mail that you send or receive, it squats in\nyour mental landscape—becoming something that’s “on your plate” in the\nsense that it has been brought to your attention and eventually needs to be\naddressed. This method closes this open loop as soon as it forms. By\nworking through the whole process, adding to your task lists and calendar\nany relevant commitments on your part, and bringing the other party up to\nspeed, your mind can reclaim the mental real estate the project once\ndemanded. Less mental clutter means more mental resources available for\ndeep thinking.\nProcess-centric e-mails might not seem natural at first. For one thing,\nthey require that you spend more time thinking about your messages before\nyou compose them. In the moment, this might seem like you’re spending\nmore time on e-mail. But the important point to remember is that the extra\ntwo to three minutes you spend at this point will save you many more\nminutes reading and responding to unnecessary extra messages later.\nThe other issue is that process-centric messages can seem stilted and\noverly technical. The current social conventions surrounding e-mail\npromote a conversational tone that clashes with the more systematic\nschedules \nor \ndecision \ntrees \ncommonly \nused \nin \nprocess-centric\ncommunication. If this concerns you, I suggest that you add a longer\nconversational preamble to your messages. You can even separate the\nprocess-centric portion of the message from the conversational opening\nwith a divider line, or label it “Proposed Next Steps,” so that its technical\ntone seems more appropriate in context.\nIn the end, these minor hassles are worth it. By putting more thought up\nfront into what’s really being proposed by the e-mail messages that flit in\nand out of your inbox, you’ll greatly reduce the negative impact of this\ntechnology on your ability to do work that actually matters.\nTip #3: Don’t Respond\nAs a graduate student at MIT, I had the opportunity to interact with famous\nacademics. In doing so, I noticed that many shared a fascinating and\nsomewhat rare approach to e-mail: Their default behavior when receiving\nan e-mail message is to not respond.\nOver time, I learned the philosophy driving this behavior: When it\ncomes to e-mail, they believed, it’s the sender’s responsibility to convince\nthe receiver that a reply is worthwhile. If you didn’t make a convincing case\nand sufficiently minimize the effort required by the professor to respond,\nyou didn’t get a response.\nFor example, the following e-mail would likely not generate a reply with\nmany of the famous names at the Institute:\nHi professor. I’d love to stop by sometime to talk about <topic X>.\nAre you available?\nResponding to this message requires too much work (“Are you\navailable?” is too vague to be answered quickly). Also, there’s no attempt to\nargue that this chat is worth the professor’s time. With these critiques in\nmind, here’s a version of the same message that would be more likely to\ngenerate a reply:\nHi professor. I’m working on a project similar to <topic X> with my\nadvisor, <professor Y>. Is it okay if I stop by in the last fifteen\nminutes of your office hours on Thursday to explain what we’re up to\nin more detail and see if it might complement your current project?\nUnlike the first message, this one makes a clear case for why this\nmeeting makes sense and minimizes the effort needed from the receiver to\nrespond.\nThis tip asks that you replicate, to the extent feasible in your\nprofessional context, this professorial ambivalence to e-mail. To help you in\nthis effort, try applying the following three rules to sort through which\nmessages require a response and which do not.\nProfessorial E-mail Sorting: Do not reply to an e-mail message if any of\nthe following applies:\n• It’s ambiguous or otherwise makes it hard for you to generate a\nreasonable response.\n• It’s not a question or proposal that interests you.\n• Nothing really good would happen if you did respond and nothing\nreally bad would happen if you didn’t.\nIn all cases, there are many obvious exceptions. If an ambiguous\nmessage about a project you don’t care about comes from your company’s\nCEO, for example, you’ll respond. But looking beyond these exceptions,\nthis professorial approach asks you to become way more ruthless when\ndeciding whether or not to click “reply.”\nThis tip can be uncomfortable at first because it will cause you to break\na key convention currently surrounding e-mail: Replies are assumed,\nregardless of the relevance or appropriateness of the message. There’s also\nno way to avoid that some bad things will happen if you take this approach.\nAt the minimum, some people might get confused or upset—especially if\nthey’ve never seen standard e-mail conventions questioned or ignored.\nHere’s the thing: This is okay. As the author Tim Ferriss once wrote:\n“Develop the habit of letting small bad things happen. If you don’t, you’ll\nnever find time for the life-changing big things.” It should comfort you to\nrealize that, as the professors at MIT discovered, people are quick to adjust\ntheir expectations to the specifics of your communication habits. The fact\nyou didn’t respond to their hastily scribed messages is probably not a\ncentral event in their lives.\nOnce you get past the discomfort of this approach, you’ll begin to\nexperience its rewards. There are two common tropes bandied around when\npeople discuss solutions to e-mail overload. One says that sending e-mails\ngenerates more e-mails, while the other says that wrestling with ambiguous\nor irrelevant e-mails is a major source of inbox-related stress. The approach\nsuggested here responds aggressively to both issues—you send fewer e-\nmails and ignore those that aren’t easy to process—and by doing so will\nsignificantly weaken the grip your inbox maintains over your time and\nattention.\nConclusion\nThe story of Microsoft’s founding has been told so many times that it’s\nentered the realm of legend. In the winter of 1974, a young Harvard student\nnamed Bill Gates sees the Altair, the world’s first personal computer, on the\ncover of Popular Electronics. Gates realizes that there’s an opportunity to\ndesign software for the machine, so he drops everything and with the help\nof Paul Allen and Monte Davidoff spends the next eight weeks hacking\ntogether a version of the BASIC programming language for the Altair. This\nstory is often cited as an example of Gates’s insight and boldness, but recent\ninterviews have revealed another trait that played a crucial role in the tale’s\nhappy ending: Gates’s preternatural deep work ability.\nAs Walter Isaacson explained in a 2013 article on the topic for the\nHarvard Gazette, Gates worked with such intensity for such lengths during\nthis two-month stretch that he would often collapse into sleep on his\nkeyboard in the middle of writing a line of code. He would then sleep for an\nhour or two, wake up, and pick up right where he left off—an ability that a\nstill-impressed Paul Allen describes as “a prodigious feat of concentration.”\nIn his book The Innovators, Isaacson later summarized Gates’s unique\ntendency toward depth as follows: “The one trait that differentiated [Gates\nfrom Allen] was focus. Allen’s mind would flit between many ideas and\npassions, but Gates was a serial obsessor.”\nIt’s here, in this story of Gates’s obsessive focus, that we encounter the\nstrongest form of my argument for deep work. It’s easy, amid the turbulence\nof a rapidly evolving information age, to default to dialectical grumbling.\nThe curmudgeons among us are vaguely uneasy about the attention people\npay to their phones, and pine for the days of unhurried concentration, while\nthe digital hipsters equate such nostalgia with Luddism and boredom, and\nbelieve that increased connection is the foundation for a utopian future.\nMarshall McLuhan declared that “the medium is the message,” but our\ncurrent conversation on these topics seems to imply that “the medium is\nmorality”—either you’re on board with the Facebook future or see it as our\ndownfall.\nAs I emphasized in this book’s introduction, I have no interest in this\ndebate. A commitment to deep work is not a moral stance and it’s not a\nphilosophical statement—it is instead a pragmatic recognition that the\nability to concentrate is a skill that gets valuable things done. Deep work is\nimportant, in other words, not because distraction is evil, but because it\nenabled Bill Gates to start a billion-dollar industry in less than a semester.\nThis is also a lesson, as it turns out, that I’ve personally relearned again\nand again in my own career. I’ve been a depth devotee for more than a\ndecade, but even I am still regularly surprised by its power. When I was in\ngraduate school, the period when I first encountered and started prioritizing\nthis skill, I found that deep work allowed me to write a pair of quality peer-\nreviewed papers each year (a respectable rate for a student), while rarely\nhaving to work past five on weekdays or work at all on weekends (a rarity\namong my peers).\nAs I neared my transition to professorship, however, I began to worry.\nAs a student and a postdoc my time commitments were minimal—leaving\nme most of my day to shape as I desired. I knew I would lose this luxury in\nthe next phase of my career, and I wasn’t confident in my ability to\nintegrate enough deep work into this more demanding schedule to maintain\nmy productivity. Instead of just stewing in my anxiety, I decided to do\nsomething about it: I created a plan to bolster my deep work muscles.\nThese training efforts were deployed during my last two years at MIT,\nwhile I was a postdoc starting to look for professor positions. My main\ntactic was to introduce artificial constraints on my schedule, so as to better\napproximate the more limited free time I expected as a professor. In\naddition to my rule about not working at night, I started to take extended\nlunch breaks in the middle of the day to go for a run and then eat lunch back\nat my apartment. I also signed a deal to write my fourth book, So Good\nThey Can’t Ignore You, during this period—a project, of course, that soon\nlevied its own intense demands on my time.\nTo compensate for these new constraints, I refined my ability to work\ndeeply. Among other methods, I began to more carefully block out deep\nwork hours and preserve them against incursion. I also developed an ability\nto carefully work through thoughts during the many hours I spent on foot\neach week (a boon to my productivity), and became obsessive about finding\ndisconnected locations conducive to focus. During the summer, for\nexample, I would often work under the dome in Barker Engineering library\n—a pleasingly cavernous location that becomes too crowded when class is\nin session, and during the winter, I sought more obscure locations for some\nsilence, eventually developing a preference for the small but well-appointed\nLewis Music Library. At some point, I even bought a $50 high-end grid-\nlined lab notebook to work on mathematical proofs, believing that its\nexpense would induce more care in my thinking.\nI ended up surprised by how well this recommitment to depth ended up\nworking. After I’d taken a job as a computer science professor at\nGeorgetown University in the fall of 2011, my obligations did in fact\ndrastically increase. But I had been training for this moment. Not only did I\npreserve my research productivity; it actually improved. My previous rate\nof two good papers a year, which I maintained as an unencumbered\ngraduate student, leapt to four good papers a year, on average, once I\nbecame a much more encumbered professor.\nImpressive as this was to me, however, I was soon to learn that I had not\nyet reached the limits of what deep work could produce. This lesson would\ncome during my third year as a professor. During my third year at\nGeorgetown, which spanned the fall of 2013 through the summer of 2014, I\nturned my attention back to my deep work habits, searching for more\nopportunities to improve. A big reason for this recommitment to depth is\nthe book you’re currently reading—most of which was written during this\nperiod. Writing a seventy-thousand-word book manuscript, of course,\nplaced a sudden new constraint on my already busy schedule, and I wanted\nto make sure my academic productivity didn’t take a corresponding hit.\nAnother reason I turned back to depth was the looming tenure process. I\nhad a year or two of publications left before my tenure case was submitted.\nThis was the time, in other words, to make a statement about my abilities\n(especially given that my wife and I were planning on growing our family\nwith a second child in the final year before tenure). The final reason I\nturned back to depth was more personal and (admittedly) a touch petulant. I\nhad applied and been rejected for a well-respected grant that many of my\ncolleagues were receiving. I was upset and embarrassed, so I decided that\ninstead of just complaining or wallowing in self-doubt, I would compensate\nfor losing the grant by increasing the rate and impressiveness of my\npublications—allowing them to declare on my behalf that I actually did\nknow what I was doing, even if this one particular grant application didn’t\ngo my way.\nI was already an adept deep worker, but these three forces drove me to\npush this habit to an extreme. I became ruthless in turning down time-\nconsuming commitments and began to work more in isolated locations\noutside my office. I placed a tally of my deep work hours in a prominent\nposition near my desk and got upset when it failed to grow at a fast enough\nrate. Perhaps most impactful, I returned to my MIT habit of working on\nproblems in my head whenever a good time presented itself—be it walking\nthe dog or commuting. Whereas earlier, I tended to increase my deep work\nonly as a deadline approached, this year I was relentless—most every day\nof most every week I was pushing my mind to grapple with results of\nconsequence, regardless of whether or not a specific deadline was near. I\nsolved proofs on subway rides and while shoveling snow. When my son\nnapped on the weekend, I would pace the yard thinking, and when stuck in\ntraffic I would methodically work through problems that were stymieing\nme.\nAs this year progressed, I became a deep work machine—and the result\nof this transformation caught me off guard. During the same year that I\nwrote a book and my oldest son entered the terrible twos, I managed to\nmore than double my average academic productivity, publishing nine peer-\nreviewed papers—all the while maintaining my prohibition on work in the\nevenings.\nI’m the first to admit that my year of extreme depth was perhaps a bit too\nextreme: It proved cognitively exhausting, and going forward I’ll likely\nmoderate this intensity. But this experience reinforces the point that opened\nthis conclusion: Deep work is way more powerful than most people\nunderstand. It’s a commitment to this skill that allowed Bill Gates to make\nthe most of an unexpected opportunity to create a new industry, and that\nallowed me to double my academic productivity the same year I decided to\nconcurrently write a book. To leave the distracted masses to join the\nfocused few, I’m arguing, is a transformative experience.\nThe deep life, of course, is not for everybody. It requires hard work and\ndrastic changes to your habits. For many, there’s a comfort in the artificial\nbusyness of rapid e-mail messaging and social media posturing, while the\ndeep life demands that you leave much of that behind. There’s also an\nuneasiness that surrounds any effort to produce the best things you’re\ncapable of producing, as this forces you to confront the possibility that your\nbest is not (yet) that good. It’s safer to comment on our culture than to step\ninto the Rooseveltian ring and attempt to wrestle it into something better.\nBut if you’re willing to sidestep these comforts and fears, and instead\nstruggle to deploy your mind to its fullest capacity to create things that\nmatter, then you’ll discover, as others have before you, that depth generates\na life rich with productivity and meaning. In Part 1, I quoted writer\nWinifred Gallagher saying, “I’ll live the focused life, because it’s the best\nkind there is.” I agree. So does Bill Gates. And hopefully now that you’ve\nfinished this book, you agree too.\nAlso by Cal Newport\nSo Good They Can’t Ignore You\nHow to Be a High School Superstar\nHow to Become a Straight-A Student\nHow to Win at College\nNotes\nIntroduction\n“In my retiring room”; “I keep the key”; and “The feeling of repose and renewal”: Jung, Carl.\nMemories, Dreams, Reflections.

You cannot gain a\nhigh h-index value simply by pumping out a lot of low-value papers, or by having a small\nnumber of papers that are cited often. This metric tends to grow over careers, which is why in\nmany fields h-index goals are tied to certain career milestones.\n“To do real good physics work”: comes around the 28:20 mark in a 1981 TV interview with\nRichard Feynman for the BBC Horizon program (the interview aired in the United States as an\nepisode of NOVA).

In particular, pages 61–65 include Morris’s catalog of Roosevelt’s collegiate\nactivities and an excerpt from a letter from Roosevelt to his mother that outlines his work habits.\nThe specific calculation that Roosevelt dedicates a quarter of his typical day to schoolwork\ncomes from page 64.\n“amazing array of interests”: from page 64 of Morris, Rise of Theodore Roosevelt.\nThe positive receipt of Roosevelt’s book by the Nuttall Bulletin comes from Morris’s endnotes: in\nparticular, note 37 in the chapter titled “The Man with the Morning in His Face.”\n“one of the most knowledgeable”: from page 67 of Morris, Rise of Theodore Roosevelt. I ascribed\nthis assessment to Morris, though this is somewhat indirect, as Morris here is actually arguing\nthat Roosevelt’s father, after the publication of The Summer Birds of the Adirondacks, must have\nfelt this about his son.\n“The amount of time he spent at his desk”: from page 64 of Morris, Rise of Theodore Roosevelt.\nMemorize a Deck of Cards\nQuotes from Daniel Kilov came from personal correspondence.

Richard Koch’s 1998 book, The 80/20\nPrinciple (New York: Crown, 1998), seems to have helped reintroduce the idea to a business\nmarket. Tim Ferriss’s 2007 mega-seller, The 4-Hour Workweek (New York: Crown, 2007),\npopularized it further, especially among the technology entrepreneur community. The Wikipedia\npage on the Pareto principle has a good summary of various places where this general idea\napplies (I drew many of my examples from here): http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle.\nQuit Social Media\n“Everything’s more exciting when it’s a party” and general information on Ryan Nicodemus’s\n“packing \nparty”: \n“Day \n3: \nPacking \nParty.” \nThe \nMinimalists.\nhttp://www.theminimalists.com/21days/day3/.\nAverage number of Twitter followers statistic comes from: “Average Twitter User Is an American\nWoman \nwith \nan \niPhone \nand \n208 \nFollowers.” \nTelegraph, \nOctober \n11, \n2012.\nhttp://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/news/9601327/Average-Twitter-user-is-an-an-American-\nwoman-with-an-iPhone-and-208-followers.html.\nTake this statistic with a grain of salt. A small number of Twitter users have such a large following\nthat the average skews high. Presumably the median would be much lower. But then again, both\nstatistics include users who signed up just to try out the service or read tweets, and who made no\nserious attempt to ever gain followers or write tweets. If we confined our attention to those who\nactually tweet and want followers, then the follower numbers would be higher.\nDon’t Use the Internet to Entertain Yourself\n“Take the case of a Londoner who works”; “great and profound mistake”; “during those\nsixteen hours he is free”; and “What?

Giving students iPads or\nallowing them to film homework assignments on YouTube prepares them for a high-tech economy\nabout as much as playing with Hot Wheels would prepare them to thrive as auto mechanics.\n* After Malcolm Gladwell popularized the idea of deliberate practice in his 2008 bestseller, Outliers:\nThe Story of Success, it became fashionable within psychology circles (a group suspicious, generally\nspeaking, of all things Gladwellian) to poke holes in the deliberate practice hypothesis. For the most\npart, however, these studies did not invalidate the necessity of deliberate practice, but instead\nattempted to identify other components also playing a role in expert performance. In a 2013 journal\narticle, titled “Why Expert Performance Is Special and Cannot Be Extrapolated from Studies of\nPerformance in the General Population: A Response to Criticisms,” and published in the journal\nIntelligence 45 (2014): 81–103, Ericsson pushed back on many of these studies. In this article,\nEricsson argues, among other things, that the experimental designs of these critical papers are often\nflawed because they assume you can extrapolate the difference between average and above average\nin a given field to the difference between expert and non-expert.\n* In the United States, there are three ranks of professors: assistant, associate, and full. You’re\ntypically hired as an assistant professor and promoted to associate professor when you receive tenure.\nFull professorship is something that usually requires many years to achieve after tenure, if you\nachieve it at all.\n* Lexical decision games flash strings of letters on the screen; some form real words, and some do\nnot. The player has to decide as quickly as possible if the word is real or not, pressing one key to\nindicate “real” and another to indicate “not real.” These tests allow you to quantify how much certain\nkeywords are “activated” in the player’s mind, because more activation leads the player to hit the\n“real word” quicker when they see it flash on the screen.\n* In Part 2, I go into more detail about why this claim is not necessarily true.\n* I’m being somewhat loose in my use of the word “individualized” here. The monastic philosophy\ndoes not apply only to those who work by themselves. There are examples of deep endeavors where\nthe work is done among a small group. Think, for example, of songwriting teams like Rodgers and\nHammerstein, or invention teams like the Wright brothers. What I really mean to indicate with my\nuse of the term is that this philosophy applies well to those who can work toward clear goals without\nthe other obligations that come along with being a member of a larger organization.\n* Supporters of open office plans might claim that they’re approximating this mix of depth and\ninteraction by making available conference rooms that people can use as needed to dive deeper into\nan idea. This conceit, however, trivializes the role of deep work in innovation. These efforts are not\nan occasional accompaniment to inspirational chance encounters; they instead represent the bulk of\nthe effort involved in most real breakthroughs.\n* You can see a snapshot of my “hour tally” online: “Deep Habits: Should You Track Hours or\nMilestones?” March 23, 2014, http://calnewport.com/blog/2014/03/23/deep-habits-should-you-track-\nhours-or-milestones/.\n* There is some debate in the literature as to whether these are the exact same quantity. For our\npurposes, however, this doesn’t matter. The key observation is that there is a limited resource,\nnecessary to attention, that must be conserved.\n* The specific article by White from which I draw the steps presented here can be found online: Ron\nWhite, “How to Memorize a Deck of Cards with Superhuman Speed,” guest post, The Art of\nManliness, June 1, 2012, http://www.artofmanliness.com/2012/06/01/how-to-memorize-a-deck-of-\ncards/.\n* Notice, the Internet sabbatical is not the same as the Internet Sabbath mentioned in Rule #2. The\nlatter asks that you regularly take small breaks from the Internet (usually a single weekend day),\nwhile the former describes a substantial and long break from an online life, lasting many weeks—and\nsometimes more.\n* It was exactly this type of analysis that supports my own lack of presence on Facebook. I’ve never\nbeen a member and I’ve undoubtedly missed out on many minor benefits of the type summarized\nabove, but this hasn’t affected my quest to maintain a thriving and rewarding social life to any\nnoticeable degree.\n* This idea has many different forms and names, including the 80/20 rule, Pareto’s principle, and, if\nyou’re feeling particularly pretentious, the principle of factor sparsity.\n* The studies I cite are looking at the activity of deliberate practice—which substantially (but not\ncompletely) overlaps our definition of deep work. For our purposes here, deliberate practice is a good\nspecific stand.in for the general category of cognitively demanding tasks to which deep work\nbelongs.\nThank you for buying this ebook, published by Hachette\nDigital.\nTo receive special offers, bonus content, and news about our latest ebooks\nand apps, sign up for our newsletters.\nSign Up\nOr visit us at hachettebookgroup.com/newsletters\nContents\nCover\nTitle Page\nWelcome\nIntroduction\nPART 1: The Idea\nChapter 1: Deep Work Is Valuable\nChapter 2: Deep Work Is Rare\nChapter 3: Deep Work Is Meaningful\nPART 2: The Rules\nRule #1: Work Deeply\nRule #2: Embrace Boredom\nRule #3: Quit Social Media\nRule #4: Drain the Shallows\nConclusion\nAlso by Cal Newport\nNotes\nNewsletters\nCopyright\nCopyright\nCopyright © 2016 by Cal Newport\nCover design by Elizabeth Turner\nCover copyright © 2016 by Hachette Book Group, Inc.\nAll rights reserved.
